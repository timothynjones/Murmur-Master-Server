He has a past medical history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease stage 3. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?",

        ],
        "correctIndex": 4,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has presented with exertional shortness of breath and chest pain, a common presentation to Cardiology. There are multiple possible causes. His examination reveals a loud and harsh ejection systolic murmur, most prominent at the right upper sternal border, radiating to the carotids. This is most likely consistent with aortic stenosis. The quiet second heart sound and the fact he is symptomatic indicate that it is likely severe in nature. He may have concomitant coronary artery disease, but given the examination findings, it is not the most likely cause of his symptoms. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy does not usually present at this age and normally causes a harsh ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border. The murmur is ejection rather than pansystolic, making mitral regurgitation unlikely. Anaemia could present in this way, but anaemia of renal disease usually occurs in advanced chronic kidney disease (4-5).",

        "explanation": "This gentleman has been resuscitated from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and little information is known about his past medical history. Examination reveals a loud continuous whirring sound, preventing auscultation of the heart sounds. These findings, combined with a wire exiting the skin (driveline) connected to a battery pack, makes it likely that this gentleman has a ventricular assist device (VAD). These are surgically inserted mechanical pumps that are used for severe heart failure. There are many potential causes of his cardiac arrest, including arrhythmogenic and structural causes. VADs can sometimes cause suction events which can produce reduced cardiac output and trigger arrhythmias. Analysis of the device is required using specialised equipment. A patent ductus arteriosus is unlikely to be present. Confusingly, its murmur is often referred to as a 'machinery-like murmur', but it sounds far more biological than a VAD. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator does not alter the heart sounds and exists entirely under the skin, usually in the pectoral region. Its battery is inbuilt and no external cabling is present. A ventricular septal defect causes a pansystolic murmur across the precordium and mitral regurgitation causes a pansystolic murmur radiating to the axilla.",

        "explanation": "This pregnant lady has attended for a routine review. Examination reveals a soft and non-radiating ejection systolic murmur, loudest at the left upper sternal border, with a normal S1 and S2, which is consistent with a flow murmur. Flow murmurs are caused by turbulence from an increased flow of blood through a structurally normal heart and can occur in a variety of pathological and physiological states, including pregnancy. Assessment would include a basic history to ensure she was not symptomatic, but management would likely be expectant as flow murmurs usually resolve once the underlying cause is removed. Significant underlying congenital or acquired heart disease can present newly in pregnancy, but is rare and would usually be symptomatic. Aortic stenosis would likely cause a loud and harsh ejection systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, radiating to the carotids. Pulmonary stenosis would cause a loud and harsh ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border. An atrial septal defect may cause an ejection systolic murmur, but would be associated with a fixed split second heart sound. Peripartum cardiomyopathy is unlikely in the absence of symptoms.",

Her heart rate is irregular due to underlying atrial fibrillation. Key aspects of the medical management would include treatment of her atrial fibrillation with anticoagulation and rate or rhythm control. Beta blockers are an effective form of rate control. Definitive intervention can either be percutaneous mitral valvotomy (expanding a balloon in the narrowed valve to improve flow through it) or surgery (e.g. mitral valve replacement or repair). The decision on which option is most appropriate would depend on leaflet mobility, thickness and calcification, as well as other factors and would usually be made by a multidisciplinary team. Percutaneous valve replacement for mitral valve disease is currently experimental and is not routinely performed, unlike for aortic stenosis.",

He has no past medical history but has been experiencing shortness of breath and dizziness at peak exertion, which he admits is worse over the last few months. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        ],
        "correctIndex": 3,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has been experiencing breathlessness and dizziness when exerting himself. Examination reveals a harsh medium-pitched ejection systolic murmur, best heard at the left upper sternal border. Additionally, there is a pansystolic murmur at the apex, radiating to the axilla. In the clinical context, this is most likely secondary to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Asymmetric septal hypertrophy can cause outflow tract obstruction, resulting in blood turbulence as it leaves the LV. This can also cause systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve and subsequent mitral regurgitation, which produces a pansystolic murmur, radiating to the axilla. This combination is classical for HCM. Aortic stenosis is very rare at this age and would likely be congenital or bicuspid. It instead produces a harsh ejection systolic murmur, loudest at the right upper sternal border, that radiates to the carotids. Aortic stenosis can sometimes cause a murmur at the apex (referred to as Gallavardin phenomenon), but this does not radiate to the axilla. Mitral regurgitation would also be very unlikely at this age and does not fit with the history. It would not be expected to cause a murmur at the left upper sternal border. Combined valve disease is even more unlikely at this age. Dilated cardiomyopathy does not have any characteristic murmurs (other than perhaps secondary mitral regurgitation). In summary, always ensure the examination is interpreted in the context of the history.",

MVP is thought to affect up to 2% of the population and involves billowing of one or both of the valve leaflets into the left atrium with or without resultant mitral regurgitation. It is more prevalent in women than men. The majority of patients follow a benign course and never require intervention. Nonetheless, the rate of sudden cardiac death is approximately doubled compared to the average population (although the absolute risk is still very low and serious events mostly occur in those with high-risk MVP). Although there are syndromic associations (such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome) the majority of cases occur in the otherwise healthy population.",

        "explanation": "This lady has a scleroderma, which is a chronic inflammatory connective tissue disease. She has presented with limiting shortness of breath on exertion and ankle swelling. Examination reveals a pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, consistent with tricuspid regurgitation. In this clinical context, these findings are highly suspicious for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PAH describes pulmonary hypertension due to abnormal pulmonary arterial vasculature and is mechanistically distinct from other causes of pulmonary hypertension (such as from left heart disease or chronic hypoxic lung disease). Inflammatory connective tissue diseases can cause PAH via a variety of mechanisms, including altering the balance between pulmonary vasodilators and vasoconstrictors and promoting vascular remodelling. This lady will require an echocardiogram (to confirm tricuspid regurgitation and estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressures). Scleroderma can also cause pulmonary fibrosis, but this would likely be associated with fine crepitations on chest auscultation. Scleroderma and other inflammatory connective tissue diseases can cause a cardiomyopathy, but it is rare and would usually present with signs of left heart failure, such as pulmonary oedema. Chronic anaemia can produce an ejection flow murmur but this is not present here. Chronic inflammatory disease does increase the risk of coronary artery disease, but this is more likely to present with chest pain.",

It is almost never normal and indicates raised, not reduced, LV filling pressures.

Examination reveals that S1 is loud and metallic, in keeping with a mechanical mitral valve replacement. The heart rate is irregular due to underlying atrial fibrillation. Additionally, there is an ejection systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, radiating to the carotids, in keeping with aortic stenosis. Therefore, this lady may well have new onset aortic stenosis and the fact she has a previous mitral valve replacement is a red herring. Unlike aortic valve replacements, well-functioning mitral valve replacements do not cause systolic flow murmurs, but they may result in soft diastolic murmurs. Prosthetic valve regurgitation through a failing mitral valve replacement would produce a pansystolic murmur at the cardiac apex, radiating to the axilla. Tricuspid regurgitation would cause a soft pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and aortic regurgitation would cause an early diastolic murmur.",

        "explanation": "This gentleman has normal heart sounds and the question is about the cardiac cycle. S1 is the first heart sound and corresponds to the closure of the mitral and then tricuspid valves (which usually occur almost simultaneously). S1 indicates the start of ventricular systole. S2 corresponds to the closure of the aortic and then pulmonary valves (which usually occur almost simultaneously, but occasionally splitting can be appreciated when the closure of the aortic valve occurs early or the closure of the pulmonary valve occurs late). Reversed splitting of S2 is rare and can occur in severe aortic stenosis or LBBB due to a delayed aortic valve closure. S2 marks the end of ventricular systole. Palpating the pulse to time the heart sounds helps to differentiate the first and second heart sounds.",

        "explanation": "This boy has presented with shortness of breath and syncopal episodes when exerting himself. Examination reveals a harsh and loud non-radiating ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border, which is in keeping with pulmonary stenosis. Given the history, his mother most likely acquired a teratogenic viral infection in pregnancy. The lack of maternal vaccinations, as well as congenital cataracts and deafness, is suggestive of congenital rubella syndrome. This is associated with peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, pulmonary valve stenosis and a patent ductus arteriosus, as well as other malformations. The examination and history are not in keeping with a flow murmur as these are, by definition, asymptomatic and produce a soft, not loud, ejection murmur at the left sternal border. A patent ductus arteriosus produces a machinery-like continuous murmur. An atrial septal defect produces an ejection murmur at the left sternal border, but is classically associated with a split second heart sound. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is associated with Williams syndrome and would produce an ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border, radiating to the carotids. An echocardiogram would be required for confirmation.",

        "question": "A 21-year-old gentleman is reviewed by his General Practitioner due to experiencing occasional palpitations. He denies any other cardiovascular symptoms, but does mention that he is under a lot of stress due to upcoming university examinations. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "correctIndex": 4,
        "explanation": "Whilst the majority of patients with isolated palpitations in this age group do not have a significant organic diagnosis, a small percentage will have underlying structural or arrhythmic cardiac disease. Examination reveals a systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border, associated with fixed splitting of the second heart sound (the splitting does not vary with respiration). This is characteristic of an atrial septal defect (ASD). ASDs can cause increased RA and RV filling, hence dilatation and arrhythmias. Pulmonary stenosis is a strong differential as it also produces an ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border, but it typically presents earlier in life and is not classically associated with fixed splitting of the second heart sound. Anxiety may be a component given the history, but with these examination findings, it should not be taken to be the sole cause of his palpitations. A bicuspid aortic valve is a common congenital anomaly and can prematurely degenerate to produce aortic stenosis in middle age. It is not associated with symptoms before this point and usually produces a quiet ejection systolic murmur with an ejection click at the right upper sternal border. A flow murmur produces a soft early systolic murmur at the left sternal border, but S1 and S2 are usually normal. There is also nothing in the history to suggest that a flow murmur may be present.",

The vast majority of such patients will have a degree of pulmonary hypertension (from destruction of lung parenchyma and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and hence increased pulmonary vascular resistance). Pulmonary hypertension causes RV pressure overload and eventually RV dilatation and failure, which is referred to as cor pulmonale. This can cause functional tricuspid regurgitation. Correspondingly, examination reveals a blowing pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, which is in keeping with this diagnosis. Confirmation would come from echocardiography, which could also estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Aortic and pulmonary regurgitation would produce early diastolic murmurs, mitral regurgitation would produce a pansystolic murmur at the cardiac apex radiating to the axilla and pulmonary stenosis would produce an ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.",

Examination reveals an ejection systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, radiating to the carotids, with a quiet second heart sound, consistent with severe aortic stenosis. Given she is fluid overloaded, she will likely need diuretics in the short term. Antihypertensives are unlikely to be indicated as controlling blood pressure is difficult and could be dangerous in aortic stenosis (lowering systemic vascular resistance could worsen the gradient across the aortic valve). Transcatheter or surgical valve replacements are the only definitive options. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty can be used as a short term option to temporarily relieve aortic obstruction, as a bridge to valve replacement, in patients with critical aortic stenosis, cardiogenic shock and heart failure.",

        "explanation": "This lady has presented with shortness of breath and the examination reveals an early diastolic murmur, loudest at the right upper and left lower sternal borders, consistent with aortic regurgitation. There is also a systolic flow murmur. Key additional examination features include a bounding/collapsing pulse (Watson's water hammer pulse), which describes a pulse with a rapid upstroke and then rapid descent, as well as an increased pulse pressure (increased difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressures). These findings are due to increased forward flow in systole and then backflow in diastole. In contrast, aortic stenosis produces a slow-rising anacrotic pulse with a decreased pulse pressure, due to the LV outflow obstruction. Aortic regurgitation can also cause a displaced, thrusting apex beat and not a tapping apex beat (which is seen in mitral stenosis) or heaving apex beat (which is seen in LV pressure overload). Other eponymous signs include Quincke's sign (nail-bed capillary pulsation), Corrigan's sign (visible carotid pulsation), de Musset's sign (head nodding which each heartbeat) and Traube's sign (a pistol shot sound when the femoral arteries are auscultated).",

        "explanation": "This gentleman has clearly had recent cardiac surgery and his presentation is concerning for infective endocarditis. Examination reveals that S1 is loud and metallic, in keeping with a mechanical mitral valve replacement. The heart rate is irregular due to underlying atrial fibrillation. Additionally, there is a loud pansystolic murmur at the cardiac apex, radiating to the axilla, which is concerning for prosthetic mitral valve regurgitation and hence valve failure. Put together, these findings suggest he may have infective endocarditis of the mitral valve replacement. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common class of causative organism in those with a valve replacement performed less than six months ago. These Gram positive bacteria often colonise prosthetic devices by forming a biofilm. In those with a valve replacement performed more than six months ago, or in those with native valves, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans are more common causes. Streptococcus pyogenes mainly causes pharyngitis, but can also cause systemic infections. Streptococcus pneumoniae also mainly causes chest infections and meningitis, but can rarely cause endocarditis.",

Examination reveals a grating and scratchy sound occurring periodically in both systole and diastole, which is consistent with a pericardial friction rub. Together with the history, the most likely diagnosis is Dressler syndrome, which is pericarditis that occurs post myocardial injury. It is thought to be an immune-related phenomenon whereby myocardial injury (e.g. from a recent MI) exposes new antigens to the immune system, resulting in pericarditis (typically within two to three weeks of the index event). In-stent thrombosis would be more likely to produce cardiac chest pain with territorial, rather than widespread, ST-elevation. An LV aneurysm can present after an MI in this time period, but would not produce a pericardial friction rub. Ischaemic mitral regurgitation would cause a pansystolic murmur, radiating to the apex. A community-acquired pneumonia would not be likely to affect the heart sounds.",

His temperature is 39.2 degrees. General examination reveals poor dental hygiene, a raised JVP and bilateral lower zone crepitations. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely underlying structure to be diseased?",

        "correctIndex": 0,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has presented with signs and symptoms of heart failure, in the context of a current fever. Examination reveals a loud early diastolic murmur, predominantly at the right upper and left lower sternal borders, with an associated quiet systolic murmur, which is likely a flow murmur. The diastolic murmur also has an associated thrill. The heart rate is irregular due to underlying atrial fibrillation. Given the history, these findings are consistent with acute aortic regurgitation secondary to infective endocarditis. Poor dental hygiene is a major risk factor, due to an increased risk of bacterial translocation into the circulation and subsequent vegetation formation on valve leaflets. Infective endocarditis of the mitral or tricuspid valve would likely cause a pansystolic murmur from regurgitation of these valves. The alveoli themselves are not diseased and the crepitations are likely from pulmonary oedema secondary to heart failure. Pericarditis usually presents with pleuritic chest pain and may cause a pericardial friction rub, not an early diastolic murmur. This gentleman needs urgent blood cultures and an echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. The treatment would be a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics.",

Key examination findings associated with mitral regurgitation include: a bounding, high volume pulse, a displaced and thrusting apex beat (due to volume overload and LV dilatation), a soft S1 and signs of pulmonary hypertension (although only in severe untreated disease). A parasternal heave is a sign that occurs in RV pressure overload from pulmonary hypertension, but it is certainly less likely to be appreciated in mitral regurgitation than apex beat displacement. Pulsus paradoxus describes a drop in systolic blood pressure of more than 10 mmHg on inspiration and occurs in pericardial tamponade. A heaving and non-displaced apex beat occurs in pressure-overloading conditions, such as aortic stenosis and systemic hypertension.",

        "explanation": "This gentleman has established hypoxic lung disease. Examination reveals a blowing pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, consistent with tricuspid regurgitation, likely from pulmonary hypertension and RV pressure overload/RV hypertrophy. A common clinical finding in this situation is a parasternal heave, where the examiner's palm is placed on the left of the sternum and feels as if it is being lifted off the chest wall with each cardiac cycle. In contrast, a heaving apex beat can be palpated at the cardiac apex in conditions causing LV pressure overload and LV hypertrophy such as hypertension and aortic stenosis. A collapsing pulse is associated with aortic regurgitation, while a narrow pulse pressure is associated with aortic stenosis. A laterally displaced apex beat is usually caused by volume-overloading conditions of the LV such as aortic and mitral regurgitation.",

Examination reveals bibasal crepitations in the chest and bilateral pedal oedema. His blood pressure is 140/60 and he is saturating 88% on 15 L oxygen. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the **least** appropriate management step?",

        ],
        "correctIndex": 4,
        "explanation": "This gentleman is critically unwell with acute heart failure. Examination reveals an early diastolic murmur, loudest at the right upper and left lower sternal borders, along with a systolic flow murmur, consistent with aortic regurgitation. The diastolic murmur also has an associated thrill. His heart rate is irregular due to underlying atrial fibrillation. Given the length of the history, it is likely he had chronic and compensated aortic regurgitation, which has now decompensated, resulting in acute pulmonary oedema. IV diuretics are vital to offload him and reduce pulmonary oedema. Likewise, IV nitrates are helpful to lower systemic blood pressure and LV afterload in order to reduce the regurgitant volume. IV digoxin may be helpful for rate control of his atrial fibrillation, but his rate is not particularly fast and as such is unlikely to make a major difference clinically. It is not likely to be harmful however. CPAP is a therapy involving a high pressure, tight-fitting mask, which increases positive end-expiratory pressure and aids with alveolar recruitment. It can be helpful in acute pulmonary oedema to improve oxygenation. An intra-aortic balloon pump is a counter-pulsation device which sits in the descending aorta. It inflates in diastole and deflates in systole. It reduces systemic afterload, while increasing diastolic pressure and hence coronary perfusion. It can be used for cardiogenic shock, especially when due to ischaemia. Given that it increases diastolic pressure, it is contraindicated in moderate-severe aortic regurgitation as it will increase the regurgitant volume.",

        "explanation": "This lady has presented with palpitations and there are many potential causes. The examination reveals normal heart sounds, but is most likely consistent with frequent ectopics as some beats occur prematurely. They are associated with a loud S1 (due to forceful closure of the atrioventricular valves), often without a corresponding S2, and then a compensatory pause. Although occasional ectopics can be normal, frequent ectopics may be symptomatic as in this case and can indicate underlying pathology, such as LV dysfunction or ischaemia. Management focuses on investigating and treating the underlying cause. Beta blockers can be helpful to reduce ectopy and rarely electrophysiological ablation is required.",

Her chest X-ray reveals fluid in the horizontal fissure and small bilateral pleural effusions. She was previously followed up for a heart problem in another country, but you do not have any further information. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following additional signs is most commonly associated with the underlying diagnosis?",

        "correctIndex": 2,
        "explanation": "Examination reveals an rumbling diastolic murmur at the cardiac apex, which is characteristic of mitral stenosis. The heart rate is irregular due to underlying atrial fibrillation. Rheumatic mitral stenosis is associated with a loud first heart sound, caused by the stiff mitral valve leaflets opposing forcefully when ventricular systole starts. Paradoxically, severe calcific mitral stenosis can instead cause a quiet first heart sound due to reduced movement of the valve leaflets. A high-arched palate is associated with Marfan syndrome (which causes aortic valve disease and mitral valve prolapse, rather than stenosis). Central cyanosis is associated with cyanotic congenital heart disease and right to left shunts. The mitral stenosis murmur is accentuated on left lateral tilt, rather than sitting forward, which instead accentuates aortic murmurs. Mitral stenosis causes a characteristic tapping, non-displaced apex beat, unlike volume overloading conditions, which displace the apex beat.",

        "explanation": "This lady has presented with features of a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), seemingly in the right middle cerebral artery distribution, with corresponding left-sided symptoms. Her symptoms have resolved without residual deficit. Patients being diagnosed with a TIA require a full workup, usually in a dedicated clinic, to establish the cause and prevent recurrence or subsequent strokes. All of the above options are potentially investigations that would be performed. However, examination reveals normal precordial heart sounds with a systolic bruit over the right carotid artery. This is potentially suggestive of carotid stenosis/atherosclerosis, which may have caused athero-embolism to the right cerebral artery. A carotid Doppler would likely be able to identify this stenosis and assess flow. If a significant stenosis is identified, the patient could be offered carotid endarterectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove the atherosclerotic plaque and reduce the risk of stroke in the future. The patient's pulse is irregular, but the variation is periodic and occurs with the respiratory cycle, indicating sinus arrhythmia and not atrial fibrillation. Nonetheless, an echocardiogram and 24-hour electrocardiogram monitor would still be required to rule out structural or arrhythmic causes, but these are less likely to identify the cause of her TIA given she has a carotid bruit. A diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance brain scan is often used post-TIA to identify regions of restricted diffusion and confirm the TIA territory, but this is unlikely to identify the cause. A full blood count will be performed to rule out polycythaemia, which is a recognised cause of TIAs, but again there is nothing in the history suggestive of this.",

Examination reveals bradycardia with a low-pitched sound at the end of diastole, just before the next S1, consistent with a 4th heart sound. Of the above options, this is most characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which produces a stiff, poorly compliant and hypertrophied LV. The absence of a systolic murmur may indicate that he does not LV outflow tract obstruction. HCM is an inherited cardiac disorder and is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes. Other cardiomyopathies are less commonly associated with abnormal heart sounds or may produce a 3rd heart sound due to fluid overload and/or LV systolic dysfunction. Brugada syndrome and long QT syndrome are arrhythmogenic disorders and do not involve structural cardiac abnormalities. They would be expected to produce normal heart sounds.",

        "explanation": "Although ECG and CXR are rarely diagnostic of valvular heart disease, they can provide important clues before obtaining echocardiographic confirmation. Examination reveals a harsh ejection systolic murmur, loudest at the right upper sternal border, radiating to the carotids, which is consistent with aortic stenosis. The most characteristic investigation finding of the above options would be calcification of the aortic knuckle on CXR, which is common in degenerative calcific aortic stenosis. ECG findings in aortic stenosis are variable, but commonly include left axis deviation, left bundle branch block and voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. An globular enlarged heart is suggestive of a pericardial effusion or a dilated LV with systolic impairment. Mitral annular calcification is common in the elderly and rarely significant, but can be associated with mitral stenosis.",

While both bioprosthetic and mechanical valves can be inserted surgically, all transcatheter valves are bioprosthetic currently. All mechanical valves require lifelong anticoagulation to prevent valve thrombosis and systemic embolisation. Unlike tissue valves, which are prone to fail after around 10-15 years, mechanical valves are designed to be lifelong, although they can fail. Conventionally, surgically inserted bioprosthetic valve replacements were generally reserved for older patients, especially if they had contraindications to anticoagulation, whereas mechanical valve replacements were preferred for younger patients. This may be subject to change with evolving transcatheter technology (including valve-in-valve treatments). Immunosuppression is not required for valve replacements, unlike for solid organ transplants.",

He has started sleeping on three pillows. Musculoskeletal examination reveals a rigid neck and back with little lateral or forward flexion. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely cause of his breathlessness?",

        "correctIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has presented with signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis, a seronegative spondyloarthropathy, which primarily affects the sacroiliac joints and axial spine. It is most common in Caucasian men between the ages of 20 and 40, especially in those with the HLA-B27 allele. It has many complications, including aortic regurgitation, AV node disease, apical lung fibrosis, anterior uveitis and enthesopathies. This gentleman has presented with breathlessness and examination reveals a loud early diastolic murmur, mainly at the right upper and left lower sternal borders, consistent with aortic regurgitation. There is a soft systolic murmur, which radiates to the carotids and is likely a flow murmur given the increased diastolic filling and hence increased systolic ejection volume in aortic regurgitation. In connective tissue disease, aortic regurgitation tends to mainly occur due to aortic root dilatation, preventing adequate coaptation of the valve leaflets. This is likely due to inflammation in the aortic root in ankylosing spondylitis, although later in the disease there may be some inflammation in the valve leaflets themselves. There is no evidence of mitral or pulmonary valve disease. He will require an echocardiogram for confirmation as well as referral to Cardiology and Rheumatology for ongoing management.",

A decision to perform a valve replacement (either transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement) is dependent on the balance between risk and benefit. Patients who would derive the most benefit are those who have limiting symptoms such as shortness of breath, which can be confidently attributed to their valve disease and not other diseases such as chronic lung disease. On echocardiography, a valve area of 1.3 cm² would be in the moderate range, whereas a peak velocity of greater than 4 m/s would be considered severe.

        "question": "You are urgently called to the ward to review a 76-year-old lady who has been admitted with intermittent palpitations and a collapse. Her admission electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus rhythm with a rate of 72 bpm. Her heart rate is currently around 190 bpm and her blood pressure is 98/66 mmHg. A new ECG confirms a narrow complex and regular rhythm, consistent with supraventricular tachycardia. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the **least** appropriate management option?",

            "Sedation and synchronised DC cardioversion"
        ],
        "correctIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "This lady has been diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), the most common form of which is AV nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT). All of the answers are potentially viable options. International guidelines recommend starting with the most conservative strategies first (i.e. vagal manoeuvres) which can terminate SVT without the need for drugs in a reasonable proportion of patients. Producing a modified Valsalva manoeuvre by asking the patient to blow into a syringe, while lifting her legs, is a good option here. Routinely, a carotid sinus massage would be another option, but examination reveals a carotid bruit on the right, without an associated cardiac murmur. This indicates the presence of carotid stenosis/atherosclerosis and as such, performing a carotid massage theoretically poses the risk of embolisation and stroke. Therefore this is the least appropriate option. Adenosine is very effective at terminating SVT, but failing this, IV beta blockers are next line. DC cardioversion is generally reserved for refractory cases, or where the patient is haemodynamically unstable. It's not completely unreasonable here, as her blood pressure is slightly low and rapid termination of SVT is required; it is unlikely a 76-year-old will tolerate a heart rate of 190 bpm for long before destabilising.",

His wife reports that he has been generally unwell and short of breath for the last two weeks. His electrocardiogram reveals T wave inversion laterally. General examination reveals crepitations bibasally in the chest and a mass in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. You also perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely underlying diagnosis?",

        "correctIndex": 2,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has presented with signs and symptoms consistent with an acute stroke, on the background of being generally unwell for the last few weeks. He also has signs of heart failure, which is a concerning combination. Examination reveals a blowing pansystolic murmur, loudest at the cardiac apex, radiating to the axilla, consistent with mitral regurgitation. Although there is a possibility that he had existing mitral regurgitation, given the current presentation, it is more likely that it is new. A left upper quadrant mass is consistent with splenomegaly. Putting these signs together, it is likely that this gentleman has infective endocarditis of the mitral valve and has developed a stroke as a consequence due to embolisation of the infective vegetation. Both splenomegaly and heart failure can be caused by infective endocarditis. Other signs to look for would be peripheral stigmata (such as splinter haemorrhages, Janeway lesions and Osler's nodes) as well as subconjunctival haemorrhages and haematuria (from immune complex deposition in the glomeruli). All of the other differentials are potential causes of a stroke in a young person. There is no evidence of a metallic valve replacement, aortic valve involvement or an atrial septal defect on examination. It is possible that he could have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that is not appreciated on examination, although this is not the most likely cause of his stroke in this clinical context.",

This lady has normal heart sounds. Nonetheless, all patients with a suspected new diagnosis of heart failure require a full blood profile (including serum BNP), a chest X-ray, an ECG and an echocardiogram (to assess biventricular function). A 24-ECG recording is not routinely required unless the patient is felt to have paroxysmal arrhythmias. Her mild bradycardia is most likely explained by her use of beta blockers.",

        "explanation": "Examination reveals a low-pitched sound just after S2, consistent with a 3rd heart sound. This is usually pathological in those over the age of 40 and indicates a volume-overloaded state, such as acute heart failure. Additional sounds can be timed by determining whether they occur just before or after systole. A 4th heart sound instead occurs at the end of diastole, just before the next S1. It indicates a stiff and poorly compliant LV. A split S1 or S2 would produce two sounds very close together, instead of a single sound. Quadruple gallop is where there is both a 3rd and 4th heart sound, hence producing four sounds in each cardiac cycle.",

        "explanation": "This lady has presented with wheeze and cough, on a background of a significant smoking history. She also has hypertension. Examination reveals an ejection systolic murmur, loudest at the right upper sternal border, but it does not radiate to the carotids. Additionally, the second heart sound is normal in character. These findings point towards a diagnosis of aortic sclerosis rather than aortic stenosis (although an echocardiogram is required for confirmation). Her presentation is consistent with respiratory disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Aortic sclerosis mostly develops in old age and is usually detected incidentally when patients are examined for another reason. It is, by definition, haemodynamically insignificant and it should not cause symptoms by itself. All valve disease is a risk factor for infective endocarditis, but aortic sclerosis is not strongly associated.

        "explanation": "This gentleman has Marfan syndrome, an inherited connective tissue disorder, caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene. There are many cardiovascular complications, including mitral valve prolapse, aortic root dilatation, aortic dissection and aortic regurgitation. Examination reveals an early diastolic murmur, loudest at the right upper and left lower sternal borders, consistent with aortic regurgitation. This can result in LV dilatation, eccentric hypertrophy and heart failure and hence cardiomegaly and Kerley B lines may well be visualised on CXR. Additionally, radiographically visible mediastinal dilatation can be seen with significant aortic root aneurysms. Regarding the ECG, aortic regurgitation can cause T wave inversion, but is not frequently associated with peaked P waves (P pulmonale), which instead indicates RA dilatation and often occurs in pulmonary hypertension. It might however result in broad or bifid P waves (P mitrale), which occurs due to LA dilatation.",

Quadruple gallop is where there is both a 3rd and 4th heart sound, hence producing four sounds in each cardiac cycle.",

        "correctIndex": 2,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has astutely detected that his own heart rate is irregular. Examination reveals normal heart sounds with a periodically irregular heart beat, that varies with respiration. This is consistent with sinus arrhythmia and is associated with a healthy autonomic nervous system. The heart rate increases slightly during inspiration due to a lower intrathoracic pressure, which decreases baroceptor firing and hence vagal tone. In expiration, the heart rate decreases as intrathoracic pressure rises, which increases baroceptor firing and vagal tone. Atrial fibrillation would produce a heart rate with no predictable beat-to-beat interval and ventricular ectopics would likely produce one-off premature beats. Even though auscultation can help to identify the underlying rhythm, an ECG is needed for confirmation.",

        "explanation": "Examination reveals a loud ejection systolic murmur, radiating to the carotids, with a quiet second heart sound, likely indicating severe aortic stenosis. In his age group, the most likely cause is senile calcific degeneration of the aortic valve leaflets. Patients with congenitally bicuspid aortic valves tend to develop aortic stenosis earlier, around middle age. Rheumatic fever is very rare in the developed world now and usually causes mitral stenosis, but can affect the aortic valve. Coronary artery disease does not cause aortic stenosis and there is no history of an iatrogenic injury to the valve.",

She did not lose continence to urine and recovered rapidly, calling an ambulance within a few minutes. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Given these findings, which of the following is most likely to be present?",

        "correctIndex": 2,
        "explanation": "This lady has presented with a syncopal event. Given the history, the two most likely differentials are structural or arrhythmogenic cardiac disease. Examination reveals a widely split S2 (i.e. a widened gap between aortic and then pulmonary valve closure), which maintains some degree of respiratory variation. This can be caused by conduction delay to the RV, such as right bundle branch block (RBBB) or mechanical factors that prolong RV ejection (such as pulmonary stenosis). Of the differentials listed, RBBB is most likely to be present, although clearly an electrocardiogram (ECG) would be required for confirmation. Although RBBB alone does not cause syncope, it can sometimes indicate that more significant conduction system disease is also present. Further ECG monitoring would be required for this lady. An atrial septal defect is very unlikely to present at this age and would usually cause a systolic murmur associated with fixed splitting of S2. Aortic stenosis is a common cause of syncope in this age group, but usually has an ejection systolic murmur radiating to the carotids. The heart rate is regular, which excludes atrial fibrillation. It is unlikely that a patient of this age has a physiologically high vagal tone and this would be expected to cause narrow splitting of S2.",

        "question": "An 80-year-old lady presents to the emergency department with a collapse when running for a bus. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following additional examination findings is most commonly associated with the likely diagnosis?",
        "answers": [
            "A wide pulse pressure",
            "A narrow pulse pressure",
            "A tapping apex beat",

            "A parasternal heave"
        ],
        "correctIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "This lady has presented with syncope on exertion, which is concerning for an underlying cardiac cause. Examination reveals a harsh ejection systolic murmur, radiating to the carotids, which is consistent with aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis is associated with a narrow pulse pressure (the gap between the systolic and diastolic blood pressure), unlike aortic regurgitation, which is associated with a widened pulse pressure. Aortic stenosis can also be associated with an anacrotic/slow rising pulse and a heaving apex beat (due to LV hypertrophy). In contrast, a parasternal heave is associated with RV hypertrophy. A thrusting apex beat is associated with conditions causing significant volume overloading of the LV, such as mitral or aortic regurgitation. A tapping apex beat is associated with mitral stenosis.",

Examination reveals a split S2 (best heard at the left upper sternal border) and both a 3rd and 4th heart sound at the left lower sternal border and cardiac apex, which is referred to as a quadruple gallop. These sounds are not audible everywhere, which is why it is important to auscultate all conventional areas of the chest before concluding on the result of the cardiovascular examination. S1 is not split. A quadruple gallop occurs when there is both fluid overload and a stiff and poorly compliant LV, as is the case in HCM.",

        "question": "You are called to see a 59-year-old gentleman who was admitted to the coronary care unit after developing an inferior myocardial infarction two days prior. He underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention, with stent insertion to the right coronary artery. He is now acutely breathless. His respiratory rate is 38 and his saturations are 85% on 15 L oxygen via a non-rebreathe mask. His chest has bilateral crepitations throughout. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely cause of his deterioration?",
        "answers": [
            "Acute ventricular septal defect",
            "Fast atrial fibrillation",
            "In-stent thrombosis and reinfarction",
            "Papillary muscle rupture",
            "LV free wall rupture"
        ],
        "correctIndex": 3,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has deteriorated rapidly a few days after a treated myocardial infarction. There are many differentials here, including impaired pump function, arrhythmias, reinfarction and structural complications. Examination reveals a soft, blowing pansystolic murmur, loudest at the cardiac apex, radiating to the axilla, consistent with mitral regurgitation. The heart rate is irregular due to atrial fibrillation and the patient's increased work of breathing can be appreciated. This is consistent with a chordal or papillary muscle rupture and hence severe mitral regurgitation. As a consequence, he has developed acute pulmonary oedema. The mortality without surgery is around 50% in the first 24 hours and as such, an urgent Cardiothoracic surgical consult is required to consider an emergency mitral valve replacement. Chordal/papillary rupture is rare in the modern era due to successful percutaneous coronary intervention as a treatment for myocardial infarction, but it most commonly occurs in inferior/posterior infarcts and involves the postero-medial papillary muscle. An acute ventricular septal defect would cause a harsh and loud pansystolic murmur at the left sternal edge, which would not be expected to radiate to the axilla. Although he does have atrial fibrillation, it is not particularly fast and would not be expected to cause this degree of deterioration. In-stent thrombosis would cause sudden severe chest pain and potentially cardiogenic shock. A ruptured LV wall usually causes sudden hypotension and then cardiac arrest due to rapid tamponade as blood leaks into the pericardium and prevents cardiac filling.",

Multifocal atrial tachycardia could present in this way, but is much rarer than AF and tends to be associated with significant respiratory disease and right heart failure, or with electrolyte depletion. Ventricular ectopics would cause one-off premature beats and sinus arrhythmia would cause periodic changes in the heart rate, associated with respiration. AF has many risk factors, including excess alcohol and obesity. An electrocardiogram would be required to confirm the diagnosis in all cases.

Examination reveals a harsh ejection systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, radiating to the carotids, with a quiet second heart sound. These findings are consistent with severe aortic stenosis. It is not currently possible to tell if her presentation is solely due to severe aortic stenosis, or whether she has also developed a concomitant myocardial infarction (MI). Even though IV nitrates are useful for both acute heart failure and cardiac ischaemia, they are contraindicated in severe aortic stenosis as they dilate the systemic circulation, which can rapidly lower blood pressure and worsen the gradient across the aortic valve. IV diuretics are vital to promote offloading and reduce pulmonary oedema. Her current blood pressure would not be a major contraindication to diuretics as her baseline blood pressure is likely to be low due to severe aortic stenosis anyway. Antiplatelet therapy may be appropriate here, at least until an MI can be excluded. CPAP is a therapy involving a high pressure, tight-fitting mask, which increases positive end-expiratory pressure and aids with alveolar recruitment. It can be helpful in acute pulmonary oedema to improve oxygenation. Urgent echocardiography is helpful to confirm the diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis and rule out other differentials.",

Examination reveals a pansystolic murmur, loudest at the cardiac apex, radiating to the axilla, consistent with mitral regurgitation. His mitral regurgitation may well be functional/secondary to chronic ischaemic papillary muscle dysfunction or LV dilatation. IV diuretics are needed to offload fluid and reduce pulmonary oedema. IV nitrates are also helpful to lower systemic blood pressure/afterload and hence reduce the forward resistance to flow into the aorta, which reduces backflow into the LA. Calcium channel blockers are contraindicated in both acute and chronic heart failure as they worsen LV function. CPAP is a therapy involving a high pressure, tight-fitting mask, which increases positive end-expiratory pressure and aids with alveolar recruitment. It can be helpful in acute pulmonary oedema to improve oxygenation. An intra-aortic balloon pump is a counter-pulsation device which sits in the descending aorta. It inflates in diastole and deflates in systole. It reduces systemic afterload, while increasing diastolic pressure and hence coronary perfusion. It can be used for cardiogenic shock, especially when due to ischaemia. By reducing afterload, it can also reduce backflow into the LA and hence reduce mitral regurgitation.",

There is also an early diastolic murmur, loudest at the right upper and left lower sternal borders, consistent with aortic regurgitation. The harsh and prominent quality of the ejection murmur indicates that it is unlikely to just be a flow murmur from aortic regurgitation and is instead due to aortic stenosis as well. Auscultating sequential areas towards the apex reveals that the murmur changes quality to a pansystolic murmur, which radiates to the axilla, consistent with mitral regurgitation. This lady therefore has mixed aortic stenosis and regurgitation as well as mitral regurgitation. She likely initially had a severely stenotic aortic valve that then became regurgitant. One explanation for concomitant mitral regurgitation is progressive LV dilatation due to untreated aortic disease and hence secondary mitral regurgitation. An echocardiogram would be required for confirmation.",

        "explanation": "This gentleman has presented with what sounds like a mechanical fall. There were no preceding symptoms or indications that he had cardiac syncope. Examination reveals an ejection systolic murmur, loudest at the right upper sternal border, but it does not radiate. This is most consistent with aortic sclerosis. Aortic sclerosis describes the thickening of the aortic valve leaflets, without narrowing of the valve orifice and as such, does not cause haemodynamic effects, unlike aortic stenosis. The murmur of aortic sclerosis classically does not radiate to the carotids. Although the murmur of aortic stenosis does not always radiate, in this clinical context, aortic sclerosis is the most likely diagnosis. Aortic sclerosis is very common in the elderly and around 2% of patients convert to aortic stenosis per year. A flow murmur could sound similar, but there is no indication of any systemic illness and it would usually cause an ejection systolic murmur, loudest at the left sternal border. There are no clinical indications of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or mitral regurgitation. It would be reasonable to arrange an non-urgent echocardiogram for this gentleman to confirm the the absence of significant valve disease.",

        "explanation": "This gentleman has an established diagnosis of multiple myeloma and has presented with new-onset heart failure and proteinuria. Examination reveals a low-pitched sound at the end of diastole, just before the next S1, consistent with a 4th heart sound, which is suggestive of a restrictive disease of the myocardium. Together, these features are in keeping with a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis, which is a well-recognised complication of multiple myeloma. The plasma cell clones produce a paraprotein which is deposited as amyloid in organs such as the kidneys and the heart. The classical features are therefore nephrotic syndrome, renal dysfunction and a restrictive cardiomyopathy. The cardiomyopathy is particularly arrhythmogenic, in keeping with this gentleman's recent collapse. Echocardiography often reveals an increased LV wall thickness with a speckled appearance and significant diastolic dysfunction, but systolic dysfunction is also possible. The diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis is confirmed by either biopsy or other imaging techniques (such as cardiac magnetic resonance or a nuclear bone scan). Chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity is a possibility and can occur with almost any chemotherapy agent, but would usually produce a dilated cardiomyopathy, which is less likely to cause a 4th heart sound and would not cause nephrotic syndrome. The history is not consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, although this could cause a 4th heart sound. Membranous glomerulonephritis may result in nephrosis, but is not specifically associated with cardiac disease. Oliguric renal failure may cause fluid overload, but this is associated with a 3rd heart sound rather than a 4th heart sound.",

Her medical background includes obesity and a ‘floppy heart valve’, but she has not attended clinic in more than a decade. Bloods are taken and the haemoglobin is 98 g/L, white cell count is 19.2 x10⁹/L and C-reactive protein is 280 mg/L. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is performed, but has limited views due to body habitus. Which of the following investigations is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",

The pulse is also irregular due to underlying atrial fibrillation. Combined with a fever and weight loss, raised inflammatory markers and a possible history of existing valve disease, this lady's presentation is consistent with infective endocarditis of the mitral valve. Mitral valve prolapse is common in the general population (approx. 2%) and is also known as 'floppy mitral valve syndrome', which may be what this lady is referring to. TTE and blood cultures are first-line investigations, but TTE has a limited resolution for the identification of vegetations and can sometimes fail to achieve adequate images due to body habitus or poor windows. Transoesophageal echocardiography is the gold standard for evaluating valvular pathology, especially of the mitral valve, which is in close proximity to the oesophagus. Cardiac computed tomography and magnetic resonance do have a role in infective endocarditis diagnosis, but are not routinely used and are inferior to transoesophageal echocardiography. Left heart catheterisation is not routinely used for mitral valve evaluation and would provide limited additional information in this context.",

Which of the following is correct regarding the underlying valve lesion?",

        "correctIndex": 4,
        "explanation": "Examination reveals an early diastolic murmur, predominantly at the right upper and left lower sternal borders, which is consistent with a diagnosis of aortic regurgitation. Aortic regurgitation is characterised by the reversal of blood flow back into the LV during diastole, which increases LV filling and hence preload. The increased preload results in an increased amount of blood being ejected during systole, and hence an increase in systolic blood pressure. Diastolic pressure decreases due to backflow however. Chronically, aortic regurgitation is usually well tolerated as the LV dilates and undergoes eccentric (rather than concentric) hypertrophy to cope with the increased volume loading. Concentric hypertrophy occurs in pressure-overloading conditions (such as hypertension and aortic stenosis) and involves extra cardiomyocytes being added in parallel, which increases LV wall thickness and decreases cavity size. Eccentric hypertrophy, however, occurs in volume-overloading conditions (such as aortic and mitral regurgitation) and involves cardiomyocytes being added in series, which increases LV cavity size but maintains normal wall thickness. When aortic regurgitation occurs acutely (such as in aortic dissection or infective endocarditis of the aortic valve), the LV does not have time to compensate, so it is very poorly tolerated and usually results in acute heart failure.",

Although the majority of cases are considered non-valvular AF, this lady's examination reveals a rumbling mid-diastolic murmur at the cardiac apex, consistent with mitral stenosis. AF in the context of moderate or severe mitral stenosis would constitute valvular AF. Unlike non-valvular AF, direct-acting oral anticoagulants are not effective in preventing strokes, and patients usually require anticoagulation with coumarin-based agents, such as warfarin. An echocardiogram is required in all patients with new atrial fibrillation for this reason. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are rate-slowing medications which help to reduce symptoms in atrial fibrillation. Admittedly, her heart rate is around 75 bpm, so there is little scope for for rate-slowing medications, but these agents could be started at low doses and reviewed, so they are potentially appropriate. Whilst a 24 hour electrocardiogram recording is not essential, it would help us to understand her average heart rate and whether she has periods of sinus rhythm (which would make this paroxysmal atrial fibrillation), so it is certainly not inappropriate.",

        "explanation": "Examination reveals a loud ejection systolic murmur, radiating to the carotids, likely indicating aortic stenosis. In her age group, the most likely cause is a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve. These valves degenerate prematurely, which can result in aortic stenosis or regurgitation by middle age. The most common cause of aortic stenosis in the elderly is senile calcific degeneration. Rheumatic fever is very rare in the developed world now and usually causes mitral stenosis, but can affect the aortic valve. Coronary artery disease does not cause aortic stenosis and there is no history of an iatrogenic injury to the valve.",

        "question": "You are asked to assess a 45-year-old lady in the Cardiology follow up clinic. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is most accurate regarding her underlying valve lesion?",
        "answers": [
            "The murmur is accentuated by inspiration",
            "The murmur is accentuated by expiration",
            "Murmur onset closer to S1 indicates a more severe lesion",
            "Murmur onset closer to S2 indicates a more severe lesion",
            "The murmur is usually diminished by the Valsalva manoeuvre"
        ],
        "correctIndex": 2,
        "explanation": "Examination reveals a quiet mid-systolic click, followed by a late systolic murmur, suggestive of mitral valve prolapse (MVP). Unlike the majority of murmurs, which are diminished by the main phase of the Valsalva manoeuvre (phase two) due to the reduced venous return to the ventricles and hence less blood flow turbulence across the valves, the murmur of MVP (and that of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) worsen on phase two of the Valsalva manoeuvre. Reduced filling of the LV reduces tension on the valve apparatus and hence allows more billowing of the leaflets in systole. This increases the severity of the prolapse and as such, the click occurs earlier in systole and the murmur is longer (i.e. it starts closer to S1). Additionally, unlike the murmurs associated with most valve disease, the respiratory cycle has little effect on the murmur of MVP.",

        "explanation": "This lady has presented with symptomatic anaemia (dizziness and shortness of breath), in the context of a presentation concerning for an undiagnosed gastrointestinal malignancy. Her examination reveals a soft ejection systolic murmur, loudest at the left upper sternal border, with a normal S1 and S2. In the clinical context, this is consistent with a flow murmur from anaemia. Flow murmurs are caused by turbulence from an increased flow of blood through a structurally normal heart and can occur in a variety of pathological and physiological states, including anaemia. Aortic stenosis could also cause shortness of breath and would result in an ejection systolic murmur, but it would likely be harsh and loudest at the right upper sternal border with radiation to the carotids. Patients with severe aortic stenosis can rarely develop a complication that could present in this way called Heyde's syndrome, which causes angiodysplasia (vascular abnormalities in the bowel that can bleed). It is thought to be secondary to an increased shear stress on blood flowing through a narrowed aortic valve, causing unfolding and consequently degradation of von Willebrand factor, which increases the predilection to bleeding and may cause angiodysplasia to develop. Pulmonary stenosis is rare, mostly congenital and would be very unlikely to newly present at this age. Aortic sclerosis would cause an ejection murmur loudest at the right upper sternal border without radiation to the carotids. Mitral regurgitation would cause a pansystolic murmur, loudest at the apex.",

        "question": "A 58-year-old lady is being investigated for a recently diagnosed appendix tumour with liver metastases, detected on an abdominal computed tomography scan. She describes a four-month history of weight loss, severe diarrhoea and abdominal pain. More recently she reports increasing shortness of breath and ankle swelling, associated with wheezing nocturnally. She has also been experiencing hot flushes daily, but put these down to the menopause. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely cause of her recent symptoms?",

            "Cardiac tuberculosis",

        ],
        "correctIndex": 3,
        "explanation": "This lady has presented with an unusual combination of clinical features. Examination reveals an ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border and a pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, potentially suggesting mixed valve disease. Appendiceal tumours are rare and are often neuroendocrine in origin. From the history, there is a sense that her diarrhoea is out of proportion to the local effects of the tumour itself. Together with recurrent flushing episodes, a new wheeze and cardiac involvement, these features raise the suspicion of carcinoid syndrome. This is a paraneoplastic syndrome caused by the secretion of vasoactive compounds (such as serotonin, histamine and kallikrein) from neuroendocrine tumours. These mediators are initially fully metabolised by the liver as they are drained by the portal circulation, but this mechanism fails once there are hepatic metastases as the mediators can then freely enter the systemic circulation. Serotonin is thought to cause a secretory diarrhoea, whilst histamine causes bronchospasm and kallikrein causes vasodilatation and flushing. Cardiac carcinoid usually involves the right side of the heart (as mediators are again broken down in the lungs before they are able to reach the left heart). It classically causes tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary stenosis (hence the mnemonic TIPS = tricuspid insufficiency and pulmonary stenosis), which is in keeping with this lady's examination findings. She will require referral to a neuroendocrine tumour specialist for ongoing assessment and management. In terms of the other answers, infective endocarditis is a potential complication of bowel cancer (often caused by the translocation of Streptococcus bovis across the bowel wall), but there are no other clinical features of infective endocarditis and it also rarely produces stenotic valve lesions. Tuberculosis is another differential as it can produce respiratory symptoms and weight loss, as well as masses in the abdomen. However, cardiac involvement is relatively rare and usually involves pericarditis or pericardial constriction and not valve disease. Iron deficiency anaemia may be a consequence of bowel malignancies and can produce a flow murmur, but the other symptoms and pansystolic murmur are not in keeping with this. Pulmonary hypertension usually causes tricuspid regurgitation but not pulmonary stenosis.",

        "explanation": "This lady has presented with a collapse and her echocardiogram is highly suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). She has LV hypertrophy with a significant outflow tract gradient. Examination reveals a harsh medium-pitched ejection systolic murmur, best heard at the left upper sternal border. Additionally there is a pansystolic murmur at the apex, radiating to the axilla. In the context of HCM, asymmetric septal hypertrophy can cause outflow tract obstruction, resulting in blood turbulence as it leaves the LV, but also causing systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve and subsequent mitral regurgitation, which produces a pansystolic murmur, radiating to the axilla. Cardiac magnetic resonance and genetic testing are often performed to confirm a diagnosis of HCM. Beta blockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are negatively inotropic, so reduce the outflow tract gradient and relieve symptoms in HCM. On the contrary, vasodilating agents (such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, oral nitrates and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) worsen the outflow tract gradient and can exacerbate symptoms. Aldosterone antagonists are mainly used for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but are also weak diuretics, and are not particularly helpful here. They may even worsen symptoms by reducing LV preload and hence worsening outflow tract obstruction.",

He was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) five years ago and was prescribed a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mask for use at night, but he admits his compliance has been poor. You notice he now has ankle swelling and a parasternal heave on examination. You also perform cardiac auscultation (below). Given these findings, which of the following is most likely diagnosis?",

        "correctIndex": 0,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has OSA. OSA involves transient nocturnal pharyngeal collapse and airflow cessation, which is interrupted by repeated partial awakening and hence results in disrupted sleep. Major risk factors include obesity, male sex and alcohol/sedatives in the evening. CPAP therapy can be used to treat OSA as it helps to splint the upper airways open at night. Untreated OSA can result in a number of complications, including pulmonary hypertension. Examination reveals an early diastolic murmur at the left upper sternal border. Combining the history and examination, he likely has pulmonary regurgitation from pulmonary hypertension. Increased pulmonary pressures of any cause can compromise pulmonary valve competency, leading to regurgitation (most classically associated with mitral stenosis; the eponymously named Graham-Steell murmur). Although pulmonary hypertension secondary to respiratory disease is more commonly associated with tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary regurgitation is also a well-recognised complication. Confirmation would come from echocardiography and treatment would usually be conservative. Aortic and pulmonary stenosis would produce an ejection systolic murmur, without a diastolic component. Aortic regurgitation would produce an early diastolic murmur loudest at the right upper and left lower sternal borders. Tricuspid regurgitation causes a pansystolic murmur at the left sternal border.",

Over the last few hours, she has been increasingly breathless and dizzy. Her blood pressure is 80/60 mmHg and her oxygen saturations are 90% on 5 L oxygen. An ECG is reveals anterior ST-elevation and Q waves. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is most likely to be present?",

        ],
        "correctIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "This lady has attended with a late-presenting anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The fact that she has Q waves indicates that the infarction has likely completed. Sudden haemodynamic and respiratory instability raises the suspicion of a mechanical complication. Although mechanical complications of STEMI are rare in the modern era due to improvements in reperfusion therapy, patients presenting after 24 hours of chest pain are at an increased risk. Examination reveals a harsh and loud pansystolic murmur, mainly at the left lower sternal border, although it is audible across the precordium. It barely radiates and as such, is most consistent with a ventricular septal rupture. The murmur is due to blood turbulence across the defect from L to R. Tricuspid regurgitation is a differential as it would also cause a pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, but the murmur is usually softer and blowing in nature and it is not a well-recognised complication of a STEMI. Papillary muscle rupture is a complication of a STEMI and causes severe acute mitral regurgitation, but this would cause a pansystolic murmur at the apex, radiating to the axilla. Ventricular free wall rupture usually causes sudden death or tamponade as the pericardium rapidly fills with blood. The history is not suggestive of aortic dissection.",

Examination reveals bradycardia (which is likely in keeping with athletic conditioning) and a split S1, best heard at the left sternal border. This is likely to be entirely physiological and represents a slight delay between the closure of the mitral valve and the tricuspid valve. An electrocardiogram and echocardiogram are reasonable given the history, but also do not definitively rule out all inherited cardiac disorders. A 3rd heart sound is a low-pitched sound at the start of diastole, while a 4th heart sound is a low-pitched sound at the end of diastole. A quadruple gallop represents the presence of both a 3rd and 4th heart sound.",

            "It results in a reduced LV preload",
            "It may initially improve the ejection fraction",

        "correctIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "Examination reveals a blowing pansystolic murmur, best heard at the cardiac apex, radiating to the axilla, consistent with mitral regurgitation. There is occasional ventricular ectopy. Mitral regurgitation is characterised by backflow of blood into the LA in systole. This results in increased diastolic filling of the LV due to this extra blood returning from the LA (hence increased preload). In systole, the LV is able to offload some of the ejected blood back into the low pressured LA, rather than the high pressured aorta and as such, afterload is reduced. For this reason, many patients with mitral regurgitation have a supra-normal ejection fraction early in the disease course (a greater fraction of blood ejected from the LV as it is easy to push it backwards into the LA). Chronically, mitral regurgitation is usually well tolerated as the LV dilates and undergoes eccentric (rather than concentric) hypertrophy to cope with the increased volume loading. Concentric hypertrophy occurs in pressure-overloading conditions (such as hypertension and aortic stenosis) and involves extra cardiomyocytes being added in parallel, which increases LV wall thickness and decreases cavity size. Eccentric hypertrophy occurs in volume-overloading conditions (including aortic and mitral regurgitation) and involves cardiomyocytes being added in series, which increases LV cavity size but maintains normal wall thickness. When mitral regurgitation occurs acutely (such as in chordal rupture or infective endocarditis), the LV does not have time to compensate, so it is very poorly tolerated and usually results in acute heart failure.",

        "correctIndex": 2,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has presented with sharp chest pain, associated with fever and night sweats. Although the differential is wide, examination reveals a grating and scratching sound, occurring periodically in both systole and diastole, consistent with a pericardial friction rub. Given the history, tuberculous pericarditis is the most likely diagnosis. Tuberculosis is a common cause of pericarditis in the developing world and may present more chronically than viral pericarditis. Rheumatic fever is rare in the developed world, but given his country of origin, it is also a differential. It usually causes mitral valvulitis and stenosis however, which would produce a rumbling diastolic murmur. Lymphoma could cause weight loss and night sweats, but would be unlikely to cause pericarditis. A pulmonary embolism would likely be more acute and could cause shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain and haemoptysis. Infective endocarditis could cause a fever and chest pain, but usually produces regurgitant valvular lesions, rather than a friction rub.",

        "explanation": "Examination of this gentleman reveals a loud early diastolic murmur, predominantly at the right upper and left lower sternal borders. This is consistent with aortic regurgitation. There is a systolic murmur, but it is quieter and may well be a flow murmur (from increased LV back filling in diastole and hence increased forward flow ejected in systole). However, it is difficult to definitively differentiate a true flow murmur in aortic regurgitation from the murmur caused by concomitant aortic stenosis, especially when the murmurs radiate to the carotids. An echocardiogram is required for confirmation. The murmur is not pansystolic and hence not consistent with tricuspid or mitral regurgitation.",

        "explanation": "This gentleman has a background of previously repaired Tetralogy of Fallot. The classic tetrad includes: RV outflow tract/pulmonary stenosis, RV hypertrophy, a ventricular septal defect (VSD) and an overriding aorta. Once detected, formal repair is usually carried out via a median sternotomy in the first year of life and involves closure of the VSD and relieving the RV outflow tract obstruction by infundibulotomy. Although surgical outcomes are good, with most infants surviving well into adulthood, more than of a third of patients develop subsequent pulmonary regurgitation secondary to the RV outflow tract repair. Although this is initially asymptomatic for many years, it eventually causes progressive RV dilatation and failure, as well as arrhythmias. Examination reveals an early diastolic murmur at the left upper sternal border, consistent with pulmonary regurgitation. This gentleman will require an echocardiogram for confirmation and then likely valve intervention (such as surgical pulmonary valve replacement or transcatheter valve implantation). Aortic regurgitation is not consistent with the history and produces an early diastolic murmur loudest at the right upper and left lower sternal borders. Pulmonary stenosis would produce an ejection systolic murmur without a diastolic component. Pulmonary hypertension may be present, but pulmonary regurgitation post tetralogy repair is usually due to the valve/RV outflow tract itself. Tricuspid regurgitation would produce a pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.",

        "question": "A 45-year-old lady is being reviewed in the valve clinic. In recent months she has had shortness of breath when climbing the stairs but not at rest. She is awaiting an up-to-date echocardiogram. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). If her echocardiogram shows severe valve disease, which of the following is the most appropriate management option?",

        ],
        "correctIndex": 0,
        "explanation": "Examination reveals a blowing pansystolic murmur, loudest at the cardiac apex, radiating to the axilla, consistent with mitral regurgitation. Given the patient is symptomatic, if the echocardiogram confirmed that the mitral regurgitation was severe in nature, then valve intervention would be indicated. As such, active monitoring is not appropriate. At her age, the most likely cause is a primary problem with the valve leaflets (primary, rather than secondary, mitral regurgitation). The mainstay of treatment for this is surgical valve replacement (or potentially surgical valve repair, if possible). In contrast, transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) of the mitral valve is mainly used for patients with severe LV failure and secondary mitral regurgitation. Although diuretics may be helpful if she is fluid overloaded, they are not appropriate in the absence of planning definitive valve intervention. Beta blockers would not be routinely indicated, unless she had an impaired ejection fraction and they were being used as a heart failure treatment.",

        "correctIndex": 4,
        "explanation": "Examination reveals a mid-late systolic murmur, heard across the precordium, but loudest at the cardiac apex, radiating to the axilla. This is suggestive of mitral valve prolapse (MVP). There is also a mid-systolic click preceding the murmur, although it is quiet in this case. The patient also has resultant primary mitral regurgitation (referring to a primary problem with the mitral valve leaflets and apparatus) after the mitral valve prolapses. A soft S1, followed by a short pause, and then the onset of the murmur can be heard. Other causes of mitral regurgitation (including secondary causes such as mitral annular dilatation) usually result in a pansystolic murmur that starts as soon as S1 finishes. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually causes a harsh ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border (but can also cause mitral regurgitation due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve in those with severe LV outflow tract obstruction). Tricuspid regurgitation produces a non-radiating pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and mitral stenosis causes a mid-late diastolic murmur.",

Examination reveals a loud blowing pansystolic murmur, predominantly heard at the cardiac apex, radiating to the axilla, consistent with mitral regurgitation. There are many causes of mitral regurgitation and these can be broadly split into those that cause primary mitral regurgitation (i.e. damage to the valve leaflets or apparatus) such as mitral valve prolapse, senile calcification, infective endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease and papillary muscle rupture, and those that cause secondary mitral regurgitation (i.e. an imbalance between the closing and tethering forces on the leaflets due to alterations in LV or LA anatomy) such as functional mitral regurgitation from any cause of LV/LA dilatation, Marfan syndrome and osteogenesis imperfecta. Coronary artery disease can cause both primary and secondary forms; chordae rupture can be caused by an acute myocardial infarction (primary), while chronic papillary muscle dysfunction/LV dilatation can be caused by ischaemic cardiomyopathy/chronic ischaemia. Pulmonary hypertension is not a cause of mitral regurgitation, but it can be a consequence as chronically raised LA pressures eventually result in raised pulmonary artery pressures.",

Additionally, there is a loud pansystolic murmur at the cardiac apex, radiating to the axilla, which is concerning for prosthetic mitral valve regurgitation and hence valve failure, which may be the cause of her presentation. An echocardiogram would be required for confirmation. A mechanical aortic valve replacement would cause a loud and metallic S2. Failing, regurgitant aortic valve replacements produce an early diastolic murmur.

If a 4th heart sound was heard, it may be more consistent with LV diastolic dysfunction, as would occur in LV concentric hypertrophy. Aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation are usually auscultated if they are present, so it would be unlikely for these to be identified on echocardiography in the absence of a murmur.

        "explanation": "Examination reveals a loud and metallic S2, in keeping with a mechanical aortic valve replacement. There is also a soft systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, which is most likely in keeping with a flow murmur. A failing aortic valve replacement would produce a loud systolic murmur if there was new significant outflow obstruction, or a diastolic murmur if there was prosthetic valve regurgitation. A mechanical mitral valve replacement would cause S1 to be loud and metallic. Pulmonary valves are rarely replaced and would be difficult to distinguish clinically from an aortic valve replacement, perhaps other than the sound being louder at the left upper sternal border, rather than the right upper sternal border.",

        "explanation": "This lady has severe aortic stenosis. A loud ejection systolic murmur radiates to the carotids. She is symptomatic with at least one of the three cardinal symptoms (shortness of breath, chest pain and syncope). The fact that the second heart sound is quiet indicates that the aortic valve is severely stenosed/calcified. Murmur loudness and radiation across the precordium have no bearing on aortic stenosis severity. A 4th heart sound may be present if there is concomitant left ventricular hypertrophy, but it does not indicate severity. There is no diastolic component to aortic stenosis.",

You notice that his jugular venous pressure is significantly elevated and auscultation of his chest reveals reduced air entry at the left middle and lower zone. His blood pressure is 60/40 mmHg. You also perform cardiovascular auscultation. Which of the following is the most important next step in his management?",

        "correctIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "This gentleman is critically unwell and is shocked. He is hypotensive and has a raised jugular venous pressure (JVP). Examination reveals quiet, muffled heart sounds. Together, these findings are consistent with pericardial tamponade, the main treatment of which is urgent pericardiocentesis. Tamponade results from a pericardial effusion preventing adequate filling of the ventricles, which critically reduces cardiac output. A raised JVP, hypotension and muffled heart sounds are together referred to as Beck's triad. Pericardial effusions increase the distance between the stethoscope and the heart, which decreases the amplitude of auscultated sounds and makes them seem distant, as if being heard from underwater. Large pericardial effusions are also known to cause compressive atelectasis of the left lower lobe, which is likely the cause of this gentleman's chest findings. An urgent bedside echocardiogram would provide confirmation before attempting pericardiocentesis. Intravenous diuretics would be used for heart failure with fluid overload, but in this case would only worsen ventricular filling and could cause this gentleman to have a cardiac arrest. On the contrary, IV fluids are sometimes used as a temporising measure in cardiac tamponade until pericardiocentesis can be performed. A chest drain or IV antibiotics would be used if there was instead a pleural effusion or evidence of sepsis. Inotropes are unlikely to be helpful as the cause of his shock is tamponade, rather than pump failure.",

He has a past medical history of hypertension. His respiratory rate is 30 and his saturations are 90% on 4 L via nasal cannulae. His electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals T wave inversion in the inferior leads and a troponin level that is four times the upper limit of normal. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below).

        "correctIndex": 3,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has presented critically unwell with severe chest and back pain. This is a worrying presentation and could potentially be caused by any of the above differentials. Examination reveals an early diastolic murmur, loudest at the right upper and left lower sternal borders, consistent with aortic regurgitation. In this clinical context, it is likely caused by aortic dissection. Aortic dissection describes the disruption of the tunica media layer of the aorta with formation and progression of a false lumen. In this case, the dissection has progressed proximally to affect the aortic root, causing acute acute aortic regurgitation and coronary ischaemia (likely the right coronary artery given the ECG findings). Acute aortic regurgitation is very poorly tolerated as the LV does not have time to dilate/compensate and hence it usually results in sudden volume overload and acute pulmonary oedema. A myocardial infarction is not the primary diagnosis, although in this case, ischaemia is caused by the dissection progressing into a coronary artery. Although cardiac tamponade can be a consequence of an aortic dissection (due to haemopericardium), there is no clinical evidence of it here. A pulmonary embolism would likely present with pleuritic chest pain and would not cause aortic regurgitation. Myocarditis would likely present as non-specific chest pain, heart failure and a troponin rise. It would not cause aortic regurgitation. This gentleman requires an urgent CT aortogram for confirmation and then onward referral to Cardiothoracic Surgery.",

Examination reveals a soft ejection systolic murmur, loudest at the left upper sternal border, with a normal S1 and S2. This is consistent with an innocent pulmonary flow murmur of childhood. These murmurs are thought to occur due to a relatively large amount of blood flowing through a relatively small pulmonary valve in childhood and they mostly disappear by adulthood. They are often positional (disappear on lying flat), do not radiate and usually reduce with Valsalva manoeuvre. They are asymptomatic and are associated with a normal electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. Very loud, harsh, radiating or diastolic murmurs are never normal and indicate an underlying pathology. Significant pathology is rarely missed on echocardiography, even when mild. Additionally, the murmur is not consistent with aortic stenosis, a ventricular septal defect or a patent ductus arteriosus. There is no clinical suggestion that the child is anaemic.",

        "explanation": "This lady has presented with a stroke at a young age. Such patients usually require an extensive workup to determine the underlying cause and prevent recurrence. Examination reveals a systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border with fixed splitting of the second heart sound (the splitting does not vary with respiration). These findings are characteristic of an atrial septal defect (ASD). ASDs are a known cause of paroxysmal embolism (from right to left) and hence are a recognised cause of cryptogenic strokes at a young age. Usually, small particles and air bubbles returning to the heart in the venous system are filtered out by the lungs, but in those with an ASD or patent foramen ovale, there is a chance they can be transmitted across the atrial septum into the left heart, resulting in systemic embolisation. All of the other answers are potential causes of premature stroke. This lady has no mentioned clinical features of infective endocarditis and this usually produces regurgitant valve lesions. Rheumatic fever is associated with mitral stenosis, but this causes a rumbling mid-diastolic murmur instead. An LV thrombus would not produce specific auscultation findings, but usually occurs in those with severe LV dysfunction, especially with apical akinesis from a prior myocardial infarction. Carotid artery atherosclerosis can be detected by auscultating a systolic bruit, which is not present here (carotid Doppler or magnetic resonance arteriography have a much better sensitivity). All patients who present with a stroke require an echocardiogram, which is the diagnostic test for an ASD.",

General examination reveals multiple erythematous macules, with central clearing, over his torso. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        ],
        "correctIndex": 3,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has presented with a variety of symptoms, which together constitute a multi-system disorder. Examination reveals a mid-late rumbling diastolic murmur with pre-systolic accentuation, loudest at the cardiac apex, which is consistent with mitral stenosis, or at least its precursor, mitral valvulitis. Together with a fever, recent pharyngitis, joint pains and an erythematous rash, acute rheumatic fever is the most likely diagnosis. Although it is rare in the modern era, it is still relatively prevalent in the Mediterranean, Middle East and South Asia, as well as other locations. The underlying cause is thought to be a type II hypersensitivity reaction after beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection, due to an antibody response against the bacteria's M-protein, which mimics cardiac antigens. The diagnosis is confirmed by establishing a recent streptococcal infection (e.g. with a raised anti-streptolysin O titre) and fulfilling the revised Jones criteria. This gentleman's rash may well represent the pathognomonic erythema marginatum and his joint pains are likely due to the distinctive migratory and flitting polyarthritis. Rheumatic fever can involve the endocardium, myocardium, pericardium or conduction system, but characteristically causes mitral valve inflammation and then stenosis. The other differentials are all possible, but are less likely. Scarlet fever is also a complication of streptococcal infections, but is a toxin-mediated condition that usually affects children, causing pharyngitis, a strawberry tongue and an erythematous sandpaper rash over the body. It does not have cardiac involvement. Tuberculosis is a key differential in a traveller with a fever and although it can affect the heart, it usually causes tuberculous pericarditis or pericardial constriction, of which there are no signs here. Systemic lupus erythematosus is another multi-system disorder, which can also affect the heart in numerous ways, but usually causes either a pericarditis, myocarditis or Libman-Sacks endocarditis, rather than mitral stenosis. Infective endocarditis usually presents with a fever and a new murmur, but usually causes valve regurgitation, rather than stenosis, and has other signs and risk factors, which are not present.",

        "question": "A 77-year-old gentleman presents with a three-month history of shortness of breath and chest pain on exertion, to the point that he is unable to leave his house. He has a background of a previous myocardial infarction. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). You suspect he has a new diagnosis of valvular heart disease. Which of the following is most accurate about his valve lesion?",

        "correctIndex": 0,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has presented with limiting symptoms and his examination reveals a loud and harsh ejection systolic murmur, radiating to the carotids, with a quiet second heart sound, consistent with severe aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis increases the risk of myocardial ischaemia, especially in those with pre-existing coronary artery disease, due to an increased afterload, which increases LV oxygen demand. Additionally, diastolic coronary filling time is often decreased due to a prolonged LV ejection time. Stenotic valve lesions usually do not develop acutely, unlike regurgitant valve lesions which can either develop acutely or chronically. Valvular heart disease is the third most common cause of heart failure in the developed world (behind coronary artery disease and hypertension). Medical therapy has no prognostic role in aortic stenosis as it does not delay the underlying disease progression. Previously, surgical aortic valve replacement was the only definitive management option, but now transcatheter aortic valve implantation is well established and has comparable results, at least over the medium term.",

You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely cause of his current symptoms?",

        "correctIndex": 3,
        "explanation": "Examination reveals the second heart sound to be a loud and metallic thud, in keeping with a mechanical aortic valve replacement. There is a soft systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, which is likely in keeping with a flow murmur and is common with mechanical aortic valve replacements. Auscultation at the left lower sternal border however reveals a pansystolic murmur, which is much quieter at the cardiac apex and does not radiate. This is consistent with tricuspid regurgitation. An important complication of aortic valve replacements is AV node injury and hence patients are consented for a small chance of needing a PPM. Dual chamber PPMs use both an RV and RA lead. The RV lead must cross the tricuspid valve and this process can sometimes either damage the tricuspid valve leaflets or impair adequate closure of the valve, resulting in tricuspid regurgitation. Given this gentleman's symptoms and examination findings, this is the likely cause of his deterioration. A gastrointestinal bleed is possible, especially given he will be taking oral anticoagulation for his mechanical mitral valve, but it is unlikely to cause a pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. A failed mechanical aortic valve replacement would likely either produce a loud early diastolic murmur (in regurgitant prosthetic failure) or a harsh ejection systolic murmur (if the valve was obstructing LV outflow). He does not have a mitral valve replacement. Mitral regurgitation would produce a pansystolic murmur that radiates to the axilla.",

Examination reveals an early diastolic murmur, loudest at the right upper and left lower sternal borders, along with a soft systolic murmur, consistent with aortic regurgitation. If his aortic regurgitation was now found to be echocardiographically severe, he would fulfil criteria for valve intervention, given he is symptomatic. He likely requires an aortic valve replacement. A decision between a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve would likely be made by a multidisciplinary team and would depend on the potential risks and benefits of each option (including the need for lifelong anticoagulation with a mechanical valve vs the potential need for redo valve replacement with a tissue valve). Both would be viable options. Medical management of aortic regurgitation includes treatment for heart failure (with diuretics) and potentially ACE inhibitors (which can also be used to lower systolic blood pressure if it is elevated). Phosphodiesterase inhibitors are used for pulmonary arterial hypertension and have no role in the management of aortic regurgitation, even if secondary pulmonary hypertension develops, as they are known to worsen outcomes in pulmonary hypertension from left-sided heart disease.",

        "explanation": "This lady has presented with cardiac symptoms on the background of a longer history of a multi-system disease. Multiple bruises, joint pains, recurrent dislocations and hyper-extensible skin are suggestive of a connective tissue disease. Examination reveals a loud late systolic murmur at the cardiac apex, radiating to the axilla, which is consistent with mitral valve prolapse. Together, these findings are suggestive of a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Formal diagnosis would be made by a Rheumatologist, but this lady would certainly require an echocardiogram to confirm mitral valve prolapse. She developed a haemorrhagic stroke previously, which can occur in the vascular variant of EDS. Although there are some features of a hereditary haemophilia, the joint features and late systolic murmur at the cardiac apex are not consistent with this diagnosis. Systemic lupus erythematosus can present in a variety of ways and is much more common in women (9:1). It mostly presents with joint pains, characteristic rashes, hair loss, mouth ulcers and internal organ involvement. Although cardiac disease is a feature, it is usually in the form of pericarditis, myocarditis or Libman-Sacks endocarditis, rather than mitral valve prolapse. Osteogenesis imperfecta is another connective tissue disease that can cause mitral valve prolapse, but it usually presents with skeletal fractures in the perinatal period. Rheumatic fever usually causes mitral stenosis and not mitral valve prolapse, and would not be expected to produce the symptom profile described here.",

Recently she has had a fever, sore throat and dry cough since she returned from a holiday in Spain. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        ],
        "correctIndex": 0,
        "explanation": "This lady has presented with sharp chest pain with a recent history of a flu-like illness. Examination reveals a grating and scratching sound, occurring periodically in both systole and diastole. This is consistent with a pericardial friction rub, which makes acute pericarditis the most likely diagnosis. A pericardial friction rub is reasonably sensitive and specific for pericarditis. Pericarditis has many causes, but viral infections are amongst the most common and it usually affects otherwise healthy individuals. Treatment would include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine. A pulmonary embolism is an important differential, given she has recently travelled, and could also present with sharp chest pain. It would not cause a pericardial friction rub and would be less likely to result in a fever. Atypical pneumonia is also a possibility and certain types (such as Legionnaires' disease) are associated with using air-conditioning units, which she may have done in the Mediterranean. It would not be expected to affect the heart sounds however. Pleurisy describes pleuritic chest pain due to pleural inflammation, usually due to infection. It would cause a pleural, not pericardial, rub. Mitral regurgitation causes a pansystolic murmur, radiating to the axilla.",

        "question": "A 44-year-old gentleman is referred to the Cardiology clinic with progressive shortness of breath. He tells you that he had a heart problem in childhood, but has not attended clinic in many years. His fingers and lips have a blue discolouration and his JVP appears elevated. You also perform cardiovascular auscultation (below). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "explanation": "There is a suggestion that this gentleman has untreated congenital heart disease and he has not attended follow up in many years. Examination reveals central cyanosis, which is a worrying feature and indicates that deoxygenated blood is being shunted into the systemic circulation before reaching the lungs. Additionally, auscultation reveals a loud and harsh non-radiating pansystolic murmur, mainly at the left lower sternal border. This is consistent with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). A VSD allows blood to be shunted from the LV to RV, which increases pulmonary blood flow and eventually causes pulmonary vascular remodelling and pulmonary hypertension, depending on the size of the shunt. Once the pulmonary hypertension becomes severe, blood may be shunted either bidirectionally or exclusively from R to L, which can result in cyanosis. This situation is referred to as Eisenmenger's syndrome. Eisenmenger's syndrome has a poor prognosis and closing the VSD may even worsen symptoms. Tricuspid regurgitation is a differential but typically causes a soft, blowing pansystolic murmur at the left sternal border and is unlikely to result in cyanosis unless it is also associated with a shunt. Mitral regurgitation produces a blowing pansystolic murmur at the cardiac apex, radiating to the axilla. Both tetralogy of Fallot and transposition of the great arteries can cause cyanosis, but would almost always present in the first year of life.",

        "explanation": "This gentleman has presented acutely unwell with a febrile illness. The track marks indicate recent intravenous drug use, which is a major risk factor for bacteraemia. Combined with the examination findings, which reveal a blowing pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, suggestive of tricuspid regurgitation, the most most likely diagnosis is infective endocarditis of the tricuspid valve. The fact that he is hypoxic, with a clear chest to auscultation, may indicate that vegetations from the tricuspid valve have embolised into the lungs causing a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Looking for peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis is also important in the examination. This gentleman will require multiple blood cultures and echocardiography. Although a community acquired pneumonia and a thyrotoxic crisis could present similarly, they would not be likely to cause a pansystolic murmur (although they could produce an ejection flow murmur at the left upper sternal border). Alcohol withdrawal, by itself, would not be expected to produce a murmur, but could cause a tremor and confusion (especially in its severest form, delirium tremens). Pericarditis could present with fever and a pericardial friction rub, but that is not present here.",

        "correctIndex": 0,
        "explanation": "This boy has presented with signs of both cardiac and hepatic disease. Examination reveals a blowing pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, consistent with tricuspid regurgitation. Together with bilateral pedal oedema and a raised JVP, this suggests significant right-sided heart disease. Ebstein's anomaly is a rare congenital heart disease causing displacement of the tricuspid valve towards the apex of the heart, with corresponding atrialisation of the RV. It can cause tricuspid regurgitation and features of right-sided heart failure, including congestive hepatopathy, as in this boy. It can present in early childhood, but also in later childhood and early adulthood with heart failure and arrhythmias. If there is an associated intra-cardiac shunt, then cyanosis may also be present. Foetal lithium exposure is a commonly cited risk factor for Ebstein's anomaly. Tetralogy of Fallot causes RV outflow tract obstruction, RV hypertrophy, an overriding aorta and a ventricular septal defect. It usually presents in infancy with cyanosis, shortness of breath and failure tor thrive. It would be rare for it to present at age 14. Hereditary haemochromatosis could present with heart and liver failure, but would not be expected to produce a murmur characteristic of tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary stenosis causes an ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border and is also usually congenital. Dilated cardiomyopathy can present in childhood but usually has left-sided symptoms including pulmonary oedema. This boy will definitely need an echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis, as well as referral to a Paediatric Cardiologist for ongoing management. Corrective surgery is possible and relatively durable long-term results are achieved in high-volume centres.",

She has an extensive cardiac history, including dilated cardiomyopathy, and recently underwent a procedure to insert a form of mechanical circulatory support. She has a midline sternotomy scar and a dressing over her upper abdomen, with a wire connected to a pack. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below).

        "explanation": "Examination reveals a continuous and loud mechanical whirring sound across the precordium, preventing auscultation of the underlying heart sounds, which is consistent with a ventricular assist device (VAD). These devices have good evidence in extending life in those with advanced heart failure, but also have many complications. Unlike a heart transplant, immunological rejection is not possible as they are entirely mechanical and contain no biological tissue. Gastrointestinal haemorrhage is common, not only because all patients with VADs require therapeutic anticoagulation, but also because the continuous flow generated by VADs themselves are thought to cause angiodysplasia in the bowel, which have a tendency to bleed. Conversely, inadequate anticoagulation can result in thrombosis inside the VAD, which can impair its function and also cause systemic embolism. VADs are powered by an external rechargeable battery pack, which is connected via a driveline that exits the patient's body under the xiphisternum. This exit point is particularly vulnerable to infection. VADs are also known to cause haemolysis due to the rotor's mechanical effect on red blood cells.",

She has a background of previous cardiac surgery, but you do not have any further details. She is saturating 92% on room air. Her bloods today reveal a C-reactive protein of 180 mg/L and her creatinine is 240 µmol/L (baseline 90 µmol/L). You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is most accurate regarding the findings?",

        ],
        "correctIndex": 4,
        "explanation": "This lady has presented with an infective illness and an acute kidney injury. Clinical examination can help to determine the source of her infection. Cardiac auscultation reveals that both S1 and S2 are loud and metallic thudding sounds, in keeping with dual mechanical valve replacements. The mechanical aortic valve can be best heard at the right upper sternal border, while the mechanical mitral valve is best heard at the cardiac apex. There is a soft ejection systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, consistent with a flow murmur from the aortic valve replacement. It does not radiate to the carotids and is much quieter at the other areas. Although it is important to consider infective endocarditis in the differential in such a case, the lack of additional regurgitant murmurs suggests that both valve replacements are well functioning. As such, this lady's presentation is more consistent with a non-cardiac infection e.g. community acquired pneumonia (especially given her cough, shortness of breath and hypoxia). Further confirmatory tests would be required, including a chest X-ray. If any concerns remained regarding the status of her valve replacements, then a transthoracic echocardiogram could be performed in the first instance.",

A 3rd heart sound is also audible, indicating fluid overload/heart failure. Given the clinical context, the most likely cause of her mitral regurgitation is mitral annular dilatation from her dilated cardiomyopathy. This would be considered functional/secondary mitral regurgitation. There are no clinical signs of aortic valve disease. Tricuspid regurgitation would cause a soft pansystolic murmur, loudest at the left lower sternal border, on inspiration.",

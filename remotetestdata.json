He has a past medical history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease stage 3. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?",

        ],
        "correctIndex": 4,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has presented with exertional shortness of breath and chest pain, a common presentation to Cardiology. There are multiple possible causes. His examination reveals a loud and harsh ejection systolic murmur, most prominent at the right upper sternal border, radiating to the carotids. This is most likely consistent with aortic stenosis. The quiet second heart sound and the fact he is symptomatic indicate that it is likely severe in nature. He may have concomitant coronary artery disease, but given the examination findings, it is not the most likely cause of his symptoms. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy does not usually present at this age and normally causes a harsh ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border. The murmur is ejection rather than pansystolic, making mitral regurgitation unlikely. Anaemia could present in this way, but anaemia of renal disease usually occurs in advanced chronic kidney disease (4-5).",

        "explanation": "This gentleman has been resuscitated from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and little information is known about his past medical history. Examination reveals a loud continuous whirring sound, preventing auscultation of the heart sounds. These findings, combined with a wire exiting the skin (driveline) connected to a battery pack, makes it likely that this gentleman has a ventricular assist device (VAD). These are surgically inserted mechanical pumps that are used for severe heart failure. There are many potential causes of his cardiac arrest, including arrhythmogenic and structural causes. VADs can sometimes cause suction events which can produce reduced cardiac output and trigger arrhythmias. Analysis of the device is required using specialised equipment. A patent ductus arteriosus is unlikely to be present. Confusingly, its murmur is often referred to as a 'machinery-like murmur', but it sounds far more biological than a VAD. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator does not alter the heart sounds and exists entirely under the skin, usually in the pectoral region. Its battery is inbuilt and no external cabling is present. A ventricular septal defect causes a pansystolic murmur across the precordium and mitral regurgitation causes a pansystolic murmur radiating to the axilla.",

        "explanation": "This pregnant lady has attended for a routine review. Examination reveals a soft and non-radiating ejection systolic murmur, loudest at the left upper sternal border, with a normal S1 and S2, which is consistent with a flow murmur. Flow murmurs are caused by turbulence from an increased flow of blood through a structurally normal heart and can occur in a variety of pathological and physiological states, including pregnancy. Assessment would include a basic history to ensure she was not symptomatic, but management would likely be expectant as flow murmurs usually resolve once the underlying cause is removed. Significant underlying congenital or acquired heart disease can present newly in pregnancy, but is rare and would usually be symptomatic. Aortic stenosis would likely cause a loud and harsh ejection systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, radiating to the carotids. Pulmonary stenosis would cause a loud and harsh ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border. An atrial septal defect may cause an ejection systolic murmur, but would be associated with a fixed split second heart sound. Peripartum cardiomyopathy is unlikely in the absence of symptoms.",

Her heart rate is irregular due to underlying atrial fibrillation. Key aspects of the medical management would include treatment of her atrial fibrillation with anticoagulation and rate or rhythm control. Beta blockers are an effective form of rate control. Definitive intervention can either be percutaneous mitral valvotomy (expanding a balloon in the narrowed valve to improve flow through it) or surgery (e.g. mitral valve replacement or repair). The decision on which option is most appropriate would depend on leaflet mobility, thickness and calcification, as well as other factors and would usually be made by a multidisciplinary team. Percutaneous valve replacement for mitral valve disease is currently experimental and is not routinely performed, unlike for aortic stenosis.",

He has no past medical history but has been experiencing shortness of breath and dizziness at peak exertion, which he admits is worse over the last few months. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        ],
        "correctIndex": 3,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has been experiencing breathlessness and dizziness when exerting himself. Examination reveals a harsh medium-pitched ejection systolic murmur, best heard at the left upper sternal border. Additionally, there is a pansystolic murmur at the apex, radiating to the axilla. In the clinical context, this is most likely secondary to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Asymmetric septal hypertrophy can cause outflow tract obstruction, resulting in blood turbulence as it leaves the LV. This can also cause systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve and subsequent mitral regurgitation, which produces a pansystolic murmur, radiating to the axilla. This combination is classical for HCM. Aortic stenosis is very rare at this age and would likely be congenital or bicuspid. It instead produces a harsh ejection systolic murmur, loudest at the right upper sternal border, that radiates to the carotids. Aortic stenosis can sometimes cause a murmur at the apex (referred to as Gallavardin phenomenon), but this does not radiate to the axilla. Mitral regurgitation would also be very unlikely at this age and does not fit with the history. It would not be expected to cause a murmur at the left upper sternal border. Combined valve disease is even more unlikely at this age. Dilated cardiomyopathy does not have any characteristic murmurs (other than perhaps secondary mitral regurgitation). In summary, always ensure the examination is interpreted in the context of the history.",

MVP is thought to affect up to 2% of the population and involves billowing of one or both of the valve leaflets into the left atrium with or without resultant mitral regurgitation. It is more prevalent in women than men. The majority of patients follow a benign course and never require intervention. Nonetheless, the rate of sudden cardiac death is approximately doubled compared to the average population (although the absolute risk is still very low and serious events mostly occur in those with high-risk MVP). Although there are syndromic associations (such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome) the majority of cases occur in the otherwise healthy population.",

        "explanation": "This lady has a scleroderma, which is a chronic inflammatory connective tissue disease. She has presented with limiting shortness of breath on exertion and ankle swelling. Examination reveals a pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, consistent with tricuspid regurgitation. In this clinical context, these findings are highly suspicious for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PAH describes pulmonary hypertension due to abnormal pulmonary arterial vasculature and is mechanistically distinct from other causes of pulmonary hypertension (such as from left heart disease or chronic hypoxic lung disease). Inflammatory connective tissue diseases can cause PAH via a variety of mechanisms, including altering the balance between pulmonary vasodilators and vasoconstrictors and promoting vascular remodelling. This lady will require an echocardiogram (to confirm tricuspid regurgitation and estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressures). Scleroderma can also cause pulmonary fibrosis, but this would likely be associated with fine crepitations on chest auscultation. Scleroderma and other inflammatory connective tissue diseases can cause a cardiomyopathy, but it is rare and would usually present with signs of left heart failure, such as pulmonary oedema. Chronic anaemia can produce an ejection flow murmur but this is not present here. Chronic inflammatory disease does increase the risk of coronary artery disease, but this is more likely to present with chest pain.",

It is almost never normal and indicates raised, not reduced, LV filling pressures.

Examination reveals that S1 is loud and metallic, in keeping with a mechanical mitral valve replacement. The heart rate is irregular due to underlying atrial fibrillation. Additionally, there is an ejection systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, radiating to the carotids, in keeping with aortic stenosis. Therefore, this lady may well have new onset aortic stenosis and the fact she has a previous mitral valve replacement is a red herring. Unlike aortic valve replacements, well-functioning mitral valve replacements do not cause systolic flow murmurs, but they may result in soft diastolic murmurs. Prosthetic valve regurgitation through a failing mitral valve replacement would produce a pansystolic murmur at the cardiac apex, radiating to the axilla. Tricuspid regurgitation would cause a soft pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and aortic regurgitation would cause an early diastolic murmur.",

        "explanation": "This gentleman has normal heart sounds and the question is about the cardiac cycle. S1 is the first heart sound and corresponds to the closure of the mitral and then tricuspid valves (which usually occur almost simultaneously). S1 indicates the start of ventricular systole. S2 corresponds to the closure of the aortic and then pulmonary valves (which usually occur almost simultaneously, but occasionally splitting can be appreciated when the closure of the aortic valve occurs early or the closure of the pulmonary valve occurs late). Reversed splitting of S2 is rare and can occur in severe aortic stenosis or LBBB due to a delayed aortic valve closure. S2 marks the end of ventricular systole. Palpating the pulse to time the heart sounds helps to differentiate the first and second heart sounds.",

        "explanation": "This boy has presented with shortness of breath and syncopal episodes when exerting himself. Examination reveals a harsh and loud non-radiating ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border, which is in keeping with pulmonary stenosis. Given the history, his mother most likely acquired a teratogenic viral infection in pregnancy. The lack of maternal vaccinations, as well as congenital cataracts and deafness, is suggestive of congenital rubella syndrome. This is associated with peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, pulmonary valve stenosis and a patent ductus arteriosus, as well as other malformations. The examination and history are not in keeping with a flow murmur as these are, by definition, asymptomatic and produce a soft, not loud, ejection murmur at the left sternal border. A patent ductus arteriosus produces a machinery-like continuous murmur. An atrial septal defect produces an ejection murmur at the left sternal border, but is classically associated with a split second heart sound. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is associated with Williams syndrome and would produce an ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border, radiating to the carotids. An echocardiogram would be required for confirmation.",

        "question": "A 21-year-old gentleman is reviewed by his General Practitioner due to experiencing occasional palpitations. He denies any other cardiovascular symptoms, but does mention that he is under a lot of stress due to upcoming university examinations. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "correctIndex": 4,
        "explanation": "Whilst the majority of patients with isolated palpitations in this age group do not have a significant organic diagnosis, a small percentage will have underlying structural or arrhythmic cardiac disease. Examination reveals a systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border, associated with fixed splitting of the second heart sound (the splitting does not vary with respiration). This is characteristic of an atrial septal defect (ASD). ASDs can cause increased RA and RV filling, hence dilatation and arrhythmias. Pulmonary stenosis is a strong differential as it also produces an ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border, but it typically presents earlier in life and is not classically associated with fixed splitting of the second heart sound. Anxiety may be a component given the history, but with these examination findings, it should not be taken to be the sole cause of his palpitations. A bicuspid aortic valve is a common congenital anomaly and can prematurely degenerate to produce aortic stenosis in middle age. It is not associated with symptoms before this point and usually produces a quiet ejection systolic murmur with an ejection click at the right upper sternal border. A flow murmur produces a soft early systolic murmur at the left sternal border, but S1 and S2 are usually normal. There is also nothing in the history to suggest that a flow murmur may be present.",

The vast majority of such patients will have a degree of pulmonary hypertension (from destruction of lung parenchyma and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and hence increased pulmonary vascular resistance). Pulmonary hypertension causes RV pressure overload and eventually RV dilatation and failure, which is referred to as cor pulmonale. This can cause functional tricuspid regurgitation. Correspondingly, examination reveals a blowing pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, which is in keeping with this diagnosis. Confirmation would come from echocardiography, which could also estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Aortic and pulmonary regurgitation would produce early diastolic murmurs, mitral regurgitation would produce a pansystolic murmur at the cardiac apex radiating to the axilla and pulmonary stenosis would produce an ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.",

Examination reveals an ejection systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, radiating to the carotids, with a quiet second heart sound, consistent with severe aortic stenosis. Given she is fluid overloaded, she will likely need diuretics in the short term. Antihypertensives are unlikely to be indicated as controlling blood pressure is difficult and could be dangerous in aortic stenosis (lowering systemic vascular resistance could worsen the gradient across the aortic valve). Transcatheter or surgical valve replacements are the only definitive options. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty can be used as a short term option to temporarily relieve aortic obstruction, as a bridge to valve replacement, in patients with critical aortic stenosis, cardiogenic shock and heart failure.",

        "explanation": "This lady has presented with shortness of breath and the examination reveals an early diastolic murmur, loudest at the right upper and left lower sternal borders, consistent with aortic regurgitation. There is also a systolic flow murmur. Key additional examination features include a bounding/collapsing pulse (Watson's water hammer pulse), which describes a pulse with a rapid upstroke and then rapid descent, as well as an increased pulse pressure (increased difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressures). These findings are due to increased forward flow in systole and then backflow in diastole. In contrast, aortic stenosis produces a slow-rising anacrotic pulse with a decreased pulse pressure, due to the LV outflow obstruction. Aortic regurgitation can also cause a displaced, thrusting apex beat and not a tapping apex beat (which is seen in mitral stenosis) or heaving apex beat (which is seen in LV pressure overload). Other eponymous signs include Quincke's sign (nail-bed capillary pulsation), Corrigan's sign (visible carotid pulsation), de Musset's sign (head nodding which each heartbeat) and Traube's sign (a pistol shot sound when the femoral arteries are auscultated).",

        "explanation": "This gentleman has clearly had recent cardiac surgery and his presentation is concerning for infective endocarditis. Examination reveals that S1 is loud and metallic, in keeping with a mechanical mitral valve replacement. The heart rate is irregular due to underlying atrial fibrillation. Additionally, there is a loud pansystolic murmur at the cardiac apex, radiating to the axilla, which is concerning for prosthetic mitral valve regurgitation and hence valve failure. Put together, these findings suggest he may have infective endocarditis of the mitral valve replacement. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common class of causative organism in those with a valve replacement performed less than six months ago. These Gram positive bacteria often colonise prosthetic devices by forming a biofilm. In those with a valve replacement performed more than six months ago, or in those with native valves, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans are more common causes. Streptococcus pyogenes mainly causes pharyngitis, but can also cause systemic infections. Streptococcus pneumoniae also mainly causes chest infections and meningitis, but can rarely cause endocarditis.",

Examination reveals a grating and scratchy sound occurring periodically in both systole and diastole, which is consistent with a pericardial friction rub. Together with the history, the most likely diagnosis is Dressler syndrome, which is pericarditis that occurs post myocardial injury. It is thought to be an immune-related phenomenon whereby myocardial injury (e.g. from a recent MI) exposes new antigens to the immune system, resulting in pericarditis (typically within two to three weeks of the index event). In-stent thrombosis would be more likely to produce cardiac chest pain with territorial, rather than widespread, ST-elevation. An LV aneurysm can present after an MI in this time period, but would not produce a pericardial friction rub. Ischaemic mitral regurgitation would cause a pansystolic murmur, radiating to the apex. A community-acquired pneumonia would not be likely to affect the heart sounds.",

His temperature is 39.2 degrees. General examination reveals poor dental hygiene, a raised JVP and bilateral lower zone crepitations. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely underlying structure to be diseased?",

        "correctIndex": 0,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has presented with signs and symptoms of heart failure, in the context of a current fever. Examination reveals a loud early diastolic murmur, predominantly at the right upper and left lower sternal borders, with an associated quiet systolic murmur, which is likely a flow murmur. The diastolic murmur also has an associated thrill. The heart rate is irregular due to underlying atrial fibrillation. Given the history, these findings are consistent with acute aortic regurgitation secondary to infective endocarditis. Poor dental hygiene is a major risk factor, due to an increased risk of bacterial translocation into the circulation and subsequent vegetation formation on valve leaflets. Infective endocarditis of the mitral or tricuspid valve would likely cause a pansystolic murmur from regurgitation of these valves. The alveoli themselves are not diseased and the crepitations are likely from pulmonary oedema secondary to heart failure. Pericarditis usually presents with pleuritic chest pain and may cause a pericardial friction rub, not an early diastolic murmur. This gentleman needs urgent blood cultures and an echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. The treatment would be a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics.",

Key examination findings associated with mitral regurgitation include: a bounding, high volume pulse, a displaced and thrusting apex beat (due to volume overload and LV dilatation), a soft S1 and signs of pulmonary hypertension (although only in severe untreated disease). A parasternal heave is a sign that occurs in RV pressure overload from pulmonary hypertension, but it is certainly less likely to be appreciated in mitral regurgitation than apex beat displacement. Pulsus paradoxus describes a drop in systolic blood pressure of more than 10 mmHg on inspiration and occurs in pericardial tamponade. A heaving and non-displaced apex beat occurs in pressure-overloading conditions, such as aortic stenosis and systemic hypertension.",

        "explanation": "This gentleman has established hypoxic lung disease. Examination reveals a blowing pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, consistent with tricuspid regurgitation, likely from pulmonary hypertension and RV pressure overload/RV hypertrophy. A common clinical finding in this situation is a parasternal heave, where the examiner's palm is placed on the left of the sternum and feels as if it is being lifted off the chest wall with each cardiac cycle. In contrast, a heaving apex beat can be palpated at the cardiac apex in conditions causing LV pressure overload and LV hypertrophy such as hypertension and aortic stenosis. A collapsing pulse is associated with aortic regurgitation, while a narrow pulse pressure is associated with aortic stenosis. A laterally displaced apex beat is usually caused by volume-overloading conditions of the LV such as aortic and mitral regurgitation.",

Examination reveals bibasal crepitations in the chest and bilateral pedal oedema. His blood pressure is 140/60 and he is saturating 88% on 15 L oxygen. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the **least** appropriate management step?",

        ],
        "correctIndex": 4,
        "explanation": "This gentleman is critically unwell with acute heart failure. Examination reveals an early diastolic murmur, loudest at the right upper and left lower sternal borders, along with a systolic flow murmur, consistent with aortic regurgitation. The diastolic murmur also has an associated thrill. His heart rate is irregular due to underlying atrial fibrillation. Given the length of the history, it is likely he had chronic and compensated aortic regurgitation, which has now decompensated, resulting in acute pulmonary oedema. IV diuretics are vital to offload him and reduce pulmonary oedema. Likewise, IV nitrates are helpful to lower systemic blood pressure and LV afterload in order to reduce the regurgitant volume. IV digoxin may be helpful for rate control of his atrial fibrillation, but his rate is not particularly fast and as such is unlikely to make a major difference clinically. It is not likely to be harmful however. CPAP is a therapy involving a high pressure, tight-fitting mask, which increases positive end-expiratory pressure and aids with alveolar recruitment. It can be helpful in acute pulmonary oedema to improve oxygenation. An intra-aortic balloon pump is a counter-pulsation device which sits in the descending aorta. It inflates in diastole and deflates in systole. It reduces systemic afterload, while increasing diastolic pressure and hence coronary perfusion. It can be used for cardiogenic shock, especially when due to ischaemia. Given that it increases diastolic pressure, it is contraindicated in moderate-severe aortic regurgitation as it will increase the regurgitant volume.",

        "explanation": "This lady has presented with palpitations and there are many potential causes. The examination reveals normal heart sounds, but is most likely consistent with frequent ectopics as some beats occur prematurely. They are associated with a loud S1 (due to forceful closure of the atrioventricular valves), often without a corresponding S2, and then a compensatory pause. Although occasional ectopics can be normal, frequent ectopics may be symptomatic as in this case and can indicate underlying pathology, such as LV dysfunction or ischaemia. Management focuses on investigating and treating the underlying cause. Beta blockers can be helpful to reduce ectopy and rarely electrophysiological ablation is required.",

Her chest X-ray reveals fluid in the horizontal fissure and small bilateral pleural effusions. She was previously followed up for a heart problem in another country, but you do not have any further information. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following additional signs is most commonly associated with the underlying diagnosis?",

        "correctIndex": 2,
        "explanation": "Examination reveals an rumbling diastolic murmur at the cardiac apex, which is characteristic of mitral stenosis. The heart rate is irregular due to underlying atrial fibrillation. Rheumatic mitral stenosis is associated with a loud first heart sound, caused by the stiff mitral valve leaflets opposing forcefully when ventricular systole starts. Paradoxically, severe calcific mitral stenosis can instead cause a quiet first heart sound due to reduced movement of the valve leaflets. A high-arched palate is associated with Marfan syndrome (which causes aortic valve disease and mitral valve prolapse, rather than stenosis). Central cyanosis is associated with cyanotic congenital heart disease and right to left shunts. The mitral stenosis murmur is accentuated on left lateral tilt, rather than sitting forward, which instead accentuates aortic murmurs. Mitral stenosis causes a characteristic tapping, non-displaced apex beat, unlike volume overloading conditions, which displace the apex beat.",

        "explanation": "This lady has presented with features of a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), seemingly in the right middle cerebral artery distribution, with corresponding left-sided symptoms. Her symptoms have resolved without residual deficit. Patients being diagnosed with a TIA require a full workup, usually in a dedicated clinic, to establish the cause and prevent recurrence or subsequent strokes. All of the above options are potentially investigations that would be performed. However, examination reveals normal precordial heart sounds with a systolic bruit over the right carotid artery. This is potentially suggestive of carotid stenosis/atherosclerosis, which may have caused athero-embolism to the right cerebral artery. A carotid Doppler would likely be able to identify this stenosis and assess flow. If a significant stenosis is identified, the patient could be offered carotid endarterectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove the atherosclerotic plaque and reduce the risk of stroke in the future. The patient's pulse is irregular, but the variation is periodic and occurs with the respiratory cycle, indicating sinus arrhythmia and not atrial fibrillation. Nonetheless, an echocardiogram and 24-hour electrocardiogram monitor would still be required to rule out structural or arrhythmic causes, but these are less likely to identify the cause of her TIA given she has a carotid bruit. A diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance brain scan is often used post-TIA to identify regions of restricted diffusion and confirm the TIA territory, but this is unlikely to identify the cause. A full blood count will be performed to rule out polycythaemia, which is a recognised cause of TIAs, but again there is nothing in the history suggestive of this.",

Examination reveals bradycardia with a low-pitched sound at the end of diastole, just before the next S1, consistent with a 4th heart sound. Of the above options, this is most characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which produces a stiff, poorly compliant and hypertrophied LV. The absence of a systolic murmur may indicate that he does not LV outflow tract obstruction. HCM is an inherited cardiac disorder and is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes. Other cardiomyopathies are less commonly associated with abnormal heart sounds or may produce a 3rd heart sound due to fluid overload and/or LV systolic dysfunction. Brugada syndrome and long QT syndrome are arrhythmogenic disorders and do not involve structural cardiac abnormalities. They would be expected to produce normal heart sounds.",

        "explanation": "Although ECG and CXR are rarely diagnostic of valvular heart disease, they can provide important clues before obtaining echocardiographic confirmation. Examination reveals a harsh ejection systolic murmur, loudest at the right upper sternal border, radiating to the carotids, which is consistent with aortic stenosis. The most characteristic investigation finding of the above options would be calcification of the aortic knuckle on CXR, which is common in degenerative calcific aortic stenosis. ECG findings in aortic stenosis are variable, but commonly include left axis deviation, left bundle branch block and voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. An globular enlarged heart is suggestive of a pericardial effusion or a dilated LV with systolic impairment. Mitral annular calcification is common in the elderly and rarely significant, but can be associated with mitral stenosis.",

While both bioprosthetic and mechanical valves can be inserted surgically, all transcatheter valves are bioprosthetic currently. All mechanical valves require lifelong anticoagulation to prevent valve thrombosis and systemic embolisation. Unlike tissue valves, which are prone to fail after around 10-15 years, mechanical valves are designed to be lifelong, although they can fail. Conventionally, surgically inserted bioprosthetic valve replacements were generally reserved for older patients, especially if they had contraindications to anticoagulation, whereas mechanical valve replacements were preferred for younger patients. This may be subject to change with evolving transcatheter technology (including valve-in-valve treatments). Immunosuppression is not required for valve replacements, unlike for solid organ transplants.",

He has started sleeping on three pillows. Musculoskeletal examination reveals a rigid neck and back with little lateral or forward flexion. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely cause of his breathlessness?",

        "correctIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has presented with signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis, a seronegative spondyloarthropathy, which primarily affects the sacroiliac joints and axial spine. It is most common in Caucasian men between the ages of 20 and 40, especially in those with the HLA-B27 allele. It has many complications, including aortic regurgitation, AV node disease, apical lung fibrosis, anterior uveitis and enthesopathies. This gentleman has presented with breathlessness and examination reveals a loud early diastolic murmur, mainly at the right upper and left lower sternal borders, consistent with aortic regurgitation. There is a soft systolic murmur, which radiates to the carotids and is likely a flow murmur given the increased diastolic filling and hence increased systolic ejection volume in aortic regurgitation. In connective tissue disease, aortic regurgitation tends to mainly occur due to aortic root dilatation, preventing adequate coaptation of the valve leaflets. This is likely due to inflammation in the aortic root in ankylosing spondylitis, although later in the disease there may be some inflammation in the valve leaflets themselves. There is no evidence of mitral or pulmonary valve disease. He will require an echocardiogram for confirmation as well as referral to Cardiology and Rheumatology for ongoing management.",

A decision to perform a valve replacement (either transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement) is dependent on the balance between risk and benefit. Patients who would derive the most benefit are those who have limiting symptoms such as shortness of breath, which can be confidently attributed to their valve disease and not other diseases such as chronic lung disease. On echocardiography, a valve area of 1.3 cm² would be in the moderate range, whereas a peak velocity of greater than 4 m/s would be considered severe.

        "question": "You are urgently called to the ward to review a 76-year-old lady who has been admitted with intermittent palpitations and a collapse. Her admission electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus rhythm with a rate of 72 bpm. Her heart rate is currently around 190 bpm and her blood pressure is 98/66 mmHg. A new ECG confirms a narrow complex and regular rhythm, consistent with supraventricular tachycardia. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the **least** appropriate management option?",

            "Sedation and synchronised DC cardioversion"
        ],
        "correctIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "This lady has been diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), the most common form of which is AV nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT). All of the answers are potentially viable options. International guidelines recommend starting with the most conservative strategies first (i.e. vagal manoeuvres) which can terminate SVT without the need for drugs in a reasonable proportion of patients. Producing a modified Valsalva manoeuvre by asking the patient to blow into a syringe, while lifting her legs, is a good option here. Routinely, a carotid sinus massage would be another option, but examination reveals a carotid bruit on the right, without an associated cardiac murmur. This indicates the presence of carotid stenosis/atherosclerosis and as such, performing a carotid massage theoretically poses the risk of embolisation and stroke. Therefore this is the least appropriate option. Adenosine is very effective at terminating SVT, but failing this, IV beta blockers are next line. DC cardioversion is generally reserved for refractory cases, or where the patient is haemodynamically unstable. It's not completely unreasonable here, as her blood pressure is slightly low and rapid termination of SVT is required; it is unlikely a 76-year-old will tolerate a heart rate of 190 bpm for long before destabilising.",

His wife reports that he has been generally unwell and short of breath for the last two weeks. His electrocardiogram reveals T wave inversion laterally. General examination reveals crepitations bibasally in the chest and a mass in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. You also perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely underlying diagnosis?",

        "correctIndex": 2,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has presented with signs and symptoms consistent with an acute stroke, on the background of being generally unwell for the last few weeks. He also has signs of heart failure, which is a concerning combination. Examination reveals a blowing pansystolic murmur, loudest at the cardiac apex, radiating to the axilla, consistent with mitral regurgitation. Although there is a possibility that he had existing mitral regurgitation, given the current presentation, it is more likely that it is new. A left upper quadrant mass is consistent with splenomegaly. Putting these signs together, it is likely that this gentleman has infective endocarditis of the mitral valve and has developed a stroke as a consequence due to embolisation of the infective vegetation. Both splenomegaly and heart failure can be caused by infective endocarditis. Other signs to look for would be peripheral stigmata (such as splinter haemorrhages, Janeway lesions and Osler's nodes) as well as subconjunctival haemorrhages and haematuria (from immune complex deposition in the glomeruli). All of the other differentials are potential causes of a stroke in a young person. There is no evidence of a metallic valve replacement, aortic valve involvement or an atrial septal defect on examination. It is possible that he could have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that is not appreciated on examination, although this is not the most likely cause of his stroke in this clinical context.",

This lady has normal heart sounds. Nonetheless, all patients with a suspected new diagnosis of heart failure require a full blood profile (including serum BNP), a chest X-ray, an ECG and an echocardiogram (to assess biventricular function). A 24-ECG recording is not routinely required unless the patient is felt to have paroxysmal arrhythmias. Her mild bradycardia is most likely explained by her use of beta blockers.",

        "explanation": "Examination reveals a low-pitched sound just after S2, consistent with a 3rd heart sound. This is usually pathological in those over the age of 40 and indicates a volume-overloaded state, such as acute heart failure. Additional sounds can be timed by determining whether they occur just before or after systole. A 4th heart sound instead occurs at the end of diastole, just before the next S1. It indicates a stiff and poorly compliant LV. A split S1 or S2 would produce two sounds very close together, instead of a single sound. Quadruple gallop is where there is both a 3rd and 4th heart sound, hence producing four sounds in each cardiac cycle.",

        "explanation": "This lady has presented with wheeze and cough, on a background of a significant smoking history. She also has hypertension. Examination reveals an ejection systolic murmur, loudest at the right upper sternal border, but it does not radiate to the carotids. Additionally, the second heart sound is normal in character. These findings point towards a diagnosis of aortic sclerosis rather than aortic stenosis (although an echocardiogram is required for confirmation). Her presentation is consistent with respiratory disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Aortic sclerosis mostly develops in old age and is usually detected incidentally when patients are examined for another reason. It is, by definition, haemodynamically insignificant and it should not cause symptoms by itself. All valve disease is a risk factor for infective endocarditis, but aortic sclerosis is not strongly associated.

        "explanation": "This gentleman has Marfan syndrome, an inherited connective tissue disorder, caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene. There are many cardiovascular complications, including mitral valve prolapse, aortic root dilatation, aortic dissection and aortic regurgitation. Examination reveals an early diastolic murmur, loudest at the right upper and left lower sternal borders, consistent with aortic regurgitation. This can result in LV dilatation, eccentric hypertrophy and heart failure and hence cardiomegaly and Kerley B lines may well be visualised on CXR. Additionally, radiographically visible mediastinal dilatation can be seen with significant aortic root aneurysms. Regarding the ECG, aortic regurgitation can cause T wave inversion, but is not frequently associated with peaked P waves (P pulmonale), which instead indicates RA dilatation and often occurs in pulmonary hypertension. It might however result in broad or bifid P waves (P mitrale), which occurs due to LA dilatation.",

Quadruple gallop is where there is both a 3rd and 4th heart sound, hence producing four sounds in each cardiac cycle.",

        "correctIndex": 2,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has astutely detected that his own heart rate is irregular. Examination reveals normal heart sounds with a periodically irregular heart beat, that varies with respiration. This is consistent with sinus arrhythmia and is associated with a healthy autonomic nervous system. The heart rate increases slightly during inspiration due to a lower intrathoracic pressure, which decreases baroceptor firing and hence vagal tone. In expiration, the heart rate decreases as intrathoracic pressure rises, which increases baroceptor firing and vagal tone. Atrial fibrillation would produce a heart rate with no predictable beat-to-beat interval and ventricular ectopics would likely produce one-off premature beats. Even though auscultation can help to identify the underlying rhythm, an ECG is needed for confirmation.",

        "explanation": "Examination reveals a loud ejection systolic murmur, radiating to the carotids, with a quiet second heart sound, likely indicating severe aortic stenosis. In his age group, the most likely cause is senile calcific degeneration of the aortic valve leaflets. Patients with congenitally bicuspid aortic valves tend to develop aortic stenosis earlier, around middle age. Rheumatic fever is very rare in the developed world now and usually causes mitral stenosis, but can affect the aortic valve. Coronary artery disease does not cause aortic stenosis and there is no history of an iatrogenic injury to the valve.",

She did not lose continence to urine and recovered rapidly, calling an ambulance within a few minutes. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Given these findings, which of the following is most likely to be present?",

        "correctIndex": 2,
        "explanation": "This lady has presented with a syncopal event. Given the history, the two most likely differentials are structural or arrhythmogenic cardiac disease. Examination reveals a widely split S2 (i.e. a widened gap between aortic and then pulmonary valve closure), which maintains some degree of respiratory variation. This can be caused by conduction delay to the RV, such as right bundle branch block (RBBB) or mechanical factors that prolong RV ejection (such as pulmonary stenosis). Of the differentials listed, RBBB is most likely to be present, although clearly an electrocardiogram (ECG) would be required for confirmation. Although RBBB alone does not cause syncope, it can sometimes indicate that more significant conduction system disease is also present. Further ECG monitoring would be required for this lady. An atrial septal defect is very unlikely to present at this age and would usually cause a systolic murmur associated with fixed splitting of S2. Aortic stenosis is a common cause of syncope in this age group, but usually has an ejection systolic murmur radiating to the carotids. The heart rate is regular, which excludes atrial fibrillation. It is unlikely that a patient of this age has a physiologically high vagal tone and this would be expected to cause narrow splitting of S2.",

        "question": "An 80-year-old lady presents to the emergency department with a collapse when running for a bus. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following additional examination findings is most commonly associated with the likely diagnosis?",
        "answers": [
            "A wide pulse pressure",
            "A narrow pulse pressure",
            "A tapping apex beat",

            "A parasternal heave"
        ],
        "correctIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "This lady has presented with syncope on exertion, which is concerning for an underlying cardiac cause. Examination reveals a harsh ejection systolic murmur, radiating to the carotids, which is consistent with aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis is associated with a narrow pulse pressure (the gap between the systolic and diastolic blood pressure), unlike aortic regurgitation, which is associated with a widened pulse pressure. Aortic stenosis can also be associated with an anacrotic/slow rising pulse and a heaving apex beat (due to LV hypertrophy). In contrast, a parasternal heave is associated with RV hypertrophy. A thrusting apex beat is associated with conditions causing significant volume overloading of the LV, such as mitral or aortic regurgitation. A tapping apex beat is associated with mitral stenosis.",

Examination reveals a split S2 (best heard at the left upper sternal border) and both a 3rd and 4th heart sound at the left lower sternal border and cardiac apex, which is referred to as a quadruple gallop. These sounds are not audible everywhere, which is why it is important to auscultate all conventional areas of the chest before concluding on the result of the cardiovascular examination. S1 is not split. A quadruple gallop occurs when there is both fluid overload and a stiff and poorly compliant LV, as is the case in HCM.",

        "question": "You are called to see a 59-year-old gentleman who was admitted to the coronary care unit after developing an inferior myocardial infarction two days prior. He underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention, with stent insertion to the right coronary artery. He is now acutely breathless. His respiratory rate is 38 and his saturations are 85% on 15 L oxygen via a non-rebreathe mask. His chest has bilateral crepitations throughout. You perform a cardiovascular examination (below). Which of the following is the most likely cause of his deterioration?",
        "answers": [
            "Acute ventricular septal defect",
            "Fast atrial fibrillation",
            "In-stent thrombosis and reinfarction",
            "Papillary muscle rupture",
            "LV free wall rupture"
        ],
        "correctIndex": 3,
        "explanation": "This gentleman has deteriorated rapidly a few days after a treated myocardial infarction. There are many differentials here, including impaired pump function, arrhythmias, reinfarction and structural complications. Examination reveals a soft, blowing pansystolic murmur, loudest at the cardiac apex, radiating to the axilla, consistent with mitral regurgitation. The heart rate is irregular due to atrial fibrillation and the patient's increased work of breathing can be appreciated. This is consistent with a chordal or papillary muscle rupture and hence severe mitral regurgitation. As a consequence, he has developed acute pulmonary oedema. The mortality without surgery is around 50% in the first 24 hours and as such, an urgent Cardiothoracic surgical consult is required to consider an emergency mitral valve replacement. Chordal/papillary rupture is rare in the modern era due to successful percutaneous coronary intervention as a treatment for myocardial infarction, but it most commonly occurs in inferior/posterior infarcts and involves the postero-medial papillary muscle. An acute ventricular septal defect would cause a harsh and loud pansystolic murmur at the left sternal edge, which would not be expected to radiate to the axilla. Although he does have atrial fibrillation, it is not particularly fast and would not be expected to cause this degree of deterioration. In-stent thrombosis would cause sudden severe chest pain and potentially cardiogenic shock. A ruptured LV wall usually causes sudden hypotension and then cardiac arrest due to rapid tamponade as blood leaks into the pericardium and prevents cardiac filling.",
